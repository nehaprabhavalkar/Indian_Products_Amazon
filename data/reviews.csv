B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-06-25,5,Consistency is gel like and has a light scent of orange which is refreshing I don’t mind the scent though..And I love this product after first time use. My skin is smooth and supple now It definitely brightens my skin after wash and leaves no dry stretchy skin. I would recommend this product it’s good refreshing face wash.
B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-01,4,It says vitamin c but it has only lemon essential oil which is not vitamin c. Vitamin c is water soluble substance which offcourse doesn't exist in lemon oil and in this product. But it is a nice facewash. Very hydrating
B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-07-02,5,This Mama Earth Vitamin C Face wash is really amazing ... it has got the benefits of Vitamin C and Turmeric .. it’s totally paraben and SLS free .. it suits all skin types .. it’s made of natural ingredients which are good for the skin .. this is truly the best Face wash I’ve ever used .. a must buy for all .. a value for money product undoubtedly!!
B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-05,1,"Don't believe positive reviews of this product...Whoever said in negative reviews are genuine..I too experienced same as like negative comments..In single wash, my face became too darker than before..I was shocked after seeing the results....I was purchased by believing all positive comments..Have doubt on ingredients ..Please don't purchase this product.. Otherwise you ended with darker skin on face.."
B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-14,1,"Don't buy if you want your skin to be like what you've now. If you want pimples you can. I usually don't get pimples. Have oily skin, but i maintain my diet. But this product will make sure you get atleast 2 pimples. I tested it twice by not using it for few days in the middle and my skin went to normal. But when i used it again the same happened.I tested again after few months and the same result."
B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-11-21,1,"This was for my son to wash his face if he kept the face wash on his hand for about 5 minutes his hands got super dry and skin coming out. I don't recommend this product. It's not the first time, the quality of cosmetics on Amazon is not good,  you get many fake products.  It's not the way amazon gives their products to customers"
B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2021-08-06,1,This is my first purchase of mama earth brand. I was keen to experience the goodness what most people are talking about. Packaging was nice but when I use this gel form face wash my eyes burn like hell. I can't even open my eyes a bit while washing face. This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!
B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-02,4,"I was looking for a mild facewash ;mamaearth is a good choice it doesn't harm your skin because no sulphates and parabeanThings I like about this productIt have a plasent smellIt have active vitamin CIt suits for all skin typesCruelty freeAffordable priceOne thing I don't like about this,they are written on their package it promotes even skin tone, I believe that face wash is not for whitening the face otherwise I like all about this product."

B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-06-28,5,Mamaearth vitamin C facewash is the best face wash i have ever used it has amazing fragrance and it makes your face cleaned deeply and yoh feels so refreshed. It has no added chemicals to it and good for both men and women and suitable for sensitive skin also as it has turmeric in it. One should try this amaing product.

   Ordered this Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo on 27 November, 2019 and it was delivered on 28 November. At the time of purchase the price was 286rs.Lately i having hair fall issue and after going through a lot of reviews and recommend on this hair fall shampoo by popular youtubers decided to give it a try.Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is 100% made-up of natural materials if you going through the ingredients to get the best out of this shampoo apply onion oil or any good oil to your hair few hours before the wash no need to apply any type of other conditioner or soap just gently apply it on your hair. It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,1,It's not good at all..Smell is okay and that's it. It doesn't cleanand neither removes oil from your hair.Might be okay for daily wash but not to clean wash. Don't go by the comments or rating given.Does it help in hairloss? I don't see any change even after several washes.

   Ordered this Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo on 27 November, 2019 and it was delivered on 28 November. At the time of purchase the price was 286rs.Lately i having hair fall issue and after going through a lot of reviews and recommend on this hair fall shampoo by popular youtubers decided to give it a try.Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is 100% made-up of natural materials if you going through the ingredients to get the best out of this shampoo apply onion oil or any good oil to your hair few hours before the wash no need to apply any type of other conditioner or soap just gently apply it on your hair. It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,1,It's not good at all..Smell is okay and that's it. It doesn't cleanand neither removes oil from your hair.Might be okay for daily wash but not to clean wash. Don't go by the comments or rating given.Does it help in hairloss? I don't see any change even after several washes.
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-28,1,"Have order this product based on reviws and its pathetic. Vary oily,sticky. Waste of money. Just to save my comment selected 1 star but this is not a starworthy product,brand"
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-12-27,1,"i have curly frizzy hair. i tried many products but could not get softness and could not control hair fall also. hair fall happens due to internal conditions. after checking reviews for this brand product, thought of trying this product. The price is high according to me.  I lost so much hair when shampooing it self. shampoo is too sticky but after head bath hair is soft. when compared with hair loss, i stopped this product. when you are buying any product check the review dates .. if the review dates are within same time, we can ignore that product.. i tried such kind of products.. those are bad only at the end.. finally coming to this product. it is making hair shine but lost so much hair. may be this suits for only silky hair people as they don't loose so much hair while taking headbath."
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-08,1,"Firstly I don't like the packaging of this shampoo.When I received the product, it was leaking. Moreover the quantity of product in the bottle isn't visible.Upon usage I noticed that my hairfall significantly increased. It's hard to rinse off and has a very sticky and greasy texture."

B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-08-12,1,"I have heard a lot about Mamaearth products and so thought of using it for my eight months old baby. This review is particularly about Mamaearth Shampoo, Everytime I applied this shampoo on my baby she used to cry inconsolably.I was sure this is a tear free shampoo and shouldn't be causing any problem , however I thought of trying it by myself for once. I was shocked only to know that it's not at all tear free and irritated my eyes like hell. Since then I am concerned how much of irritation and itching my baby has suffered because of this. I definitely won't recommend this shampoo for babies, Big No No !"
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-16,1,There is a change of formulation of the product. Earlier it used to be thick but now it is quite liquidy. Change in the design of pump also which promotes wastage. The outcome of the product is also not good. The hair becomes dry. They have added a scent also now. Same is with the body wash. The quality of their products has deteriorated and cheap tactics of product wastage to promote sales is disappointing. The fact that they changed the formulation without mentioning it can be called cheating the customers. #nonethical business practices.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-13,3,What I liked :1. Plant based and minimal chemicals for baby safe usage2. No tears3. lathers well on oiled hairWhat concerned me:1. Scent is not good.Its ok2. Requires 2 washes for oiled hair to get rid of the grease completely (although I don’t go for 2nd round for my baby).3. This goes for all mama earth products: Overpriced.Just because it’s plant based /minimal chemicals.If you really want to go for 100% chemical free for your baby then you could prepare your own DIY using Fenugreek powder & curds. It’s messy a bit but 100 % safe for babies
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-06-08,4,It is a very mild shampoo. Gentle on the hair & scalp. Good for daily or alternate use. But my hair fall is still there.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-08-28,5,Very nice shampoo. Makes my baby’s hair soft and shiny with a nice light scent. I really like the ingredients in it
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-01-10,5,Good product from Mama earth. Lathers well and rinses off oil from my toddlers hair pretty easily. My daughter has curly dry hair but this one doesn't make it too dry. I tried brands like Aveeno & L'Oréal for kids but this one is far better than those. Have been using it since a year and pretty happy with the product
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-09-26,4,"I m 30 years old,, i have hair related problems from childhood,, so somebody told me to use baby shampoo,, i bought this one,, after johnsons baby shampoo,, this is good for cleaning oil,( applied one night before)from hairs in one wash,, u dont need to wash hair second time. Although it feels light burning while entering in the eyes so be careful when apply on babies. Hair becomes neither so rough nor so silky. Soso. I have dry hairs with dandruff issue. It helps in them."

My skin is smooth and supple now It definitely brightens my skin after wash and leaves no dry stretchy skin. I would recommend this product it’s good refreshing face wash.
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-01,4,It says vitamin c but it has only lemon essential oil which is not vitamin c. Vitamin c is water soluble substance which offcourse doesn't exist in lemon oil and in this product. But it is a nice facewash. Very hydrating

When I hear about Mama earth I just wanted to try once and bought coco body lotion. "" I'm surprised with the results"". When I used for the first time I don't believe it last longer but it last up to 8hrs with out oily, sticky skin, after using 4 days (daily 2 times) all cracks on my skin completely healed and became soft and healthy. Ok fragrance is good with chocolate and coffee fragrance, even I feel fragrance after 8hrs, but I get what I want for my skin"

But after applying this on my face I sweat a lot. Most importantly, the products are cruelty-free, mamearth claims that. I just have a question ""mamaearth claims that they plant a tree for every purchase so did they really plant a tree when i bought their products from amazon not from their website?""Please do answer it.I received the broken cap of the second bottle."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-12,5,"Mamaearth Ubtan Body Lotion moisturizes my skin really well. This is non-sticky yet good for this winter. I apply this product only after showering and my skin is well hydrated throughout the day. The scent is mild so doesn't bother much. It helps to even out the skin tone too. It suits for differnt skin types too, like my skin is normal whereas my sister has dry skin and she gets good result too.It's a very good product overall."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-03,5,This lotion is hands down the best I've used so far. It smells like a heavenly cup of coffee with a huge slice of delicious chocolate cake. And my skin feels super soft and healthy. Love this ❤
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-12-27,5,The fragrance is good. Mosturising stays for long hours. The tempreture here where I stay is very low and also air is dry. I mix a little of other mosturiser in it but overall it is a good product.

B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-03-26,4,Not enough moisturizing even though I have oily skin. The scent is quite good. But does not linger. It takes a little while to get absorbed but lasts a long time on skin.

It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"

But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.

The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."

Otherwise you ended with darker skin on face.."
B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-14,1,"Don't buy if you want your skin to be like what you've now. If you want pimples you can. I usually don't get pimples. Have oily skin, but i maintain my diet. But this product will make sure you get atleast 2 pimples. I tested it twice by not using it for few days in the middle and my skin went to normal. But when i used it again the same happened.I tested again after few months and the same result."

I don't recommend this product. It's not the first time, the quality of cosmetics on Amazon is not good,  you get many fake products.  It's not the way amazon gives their products to customers"
B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2021-08-06,1,This is my first purchase of mama earth brand. I was keen to experience the goodness what most people are talking about. Packaging was nice but when I use this gel form face wash my eyes burn like hell. I can't even open my eyes a bit while washing face. This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!

B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-07-02,5,This Mama Earth Vitamin C Face wash is really amazing ... it has got the benefits of Vitamin C and Turmeric .. it’s totally paraben and SLS free .. it suits all skin types .. it’s made of natural ingredients which are good for the skin .. this is truly the best Face wash I’ve ever used .. a must buy for all .. a value for money product undoubtedly!!
B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-05,1,"Don't believe positive reviews of this product...Whoever said in negative reviews are genuine..I too experienced same as like negative comments..In single wash, my face became too darker than before..I was shocked after seeing the results....I was purchased by believing all positive comments..Have doubt on ingredients ..Please don't purchase this product.. Otherwise you ended with darker skin on face.."
B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-14,1,"Don't buy if you want your skin to be like what you've now. If you want pimples you can. I usually don't get pimples. Have oily skin, but i maintain my diet. But this product will make sure you get atleast 2 pimples. I tested it twice by not using it for few days in the middle and my skin went to normal. But when i used it again the same happened.I tested again after few months and the same result."

B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2021-08-06,1,This is my first purchase of mama earth brand. I was keen to experience the goodness what most people are talking about. Packaging was nice but when I use this gel form face wash my eyes burn like hell. I can't even open my eyes a bit while washing face. This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!

It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since.

The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight.

I lost so much hair when shampooing it self. shampoo is too sticky but after head bath hair is soft. when compared with hair loss, i stopped this product. when you are buying any product check the review dates .. if the review dates are within same time, we can ignore that product.. i tried such kind of products.. those are bad only at the end.. finally coming to this product. it is making hair shine but lost so much hair. may be this suits for only silky hair people as they don't loose so much hair while taking headbath."
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-08,1,"Firstly I don't like the packaging of this shampoo.When I received the product, it was leaking. Moreover the quantity of product in the bottle isn't visible.Upon usage I noticed that my hairfall significantly increased. It's hard to rinse off and has a very sticky and greasy texture."
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-11-12,2,"Reviews really helps to buy other people that’s why I’m always writing and I ll also buy product after read the reviews,Actually this product is not working for me , hair fall is not coming to control and falling more after start using this, and I am writing this after using 3 weeks, but it’s keeping hair soft , before this product I was used kadhi shikakai shampoo it’s control hair fall within 1 or 2 use, I’m not happy with mama earth , but I buy this after reading so many positive reviews"
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2020-11-26,5,Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is  made-up of natural ingredients its a paraben free sls free shampoo  It's  cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect.  So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive results. Overall really good product..
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-08-12,1,"I have heard a lot about Mamaearth products and so thought of using it for my eight months old baby. This review is particularly about Mamaearth Shampoo, Everytime I applied this shampoo on my baby she used to cry inconsolably.I was sure this is a tear free shampoo and shouldn't be causing any problem , however I thought of trying it by myself for once. I was shocked only to know that it's not at all tear free and irritated my eyes like hell. Since then I am concerned how much of irritation and itching my baby has suffered because of this. I definitely won't recommend this shampoo for babies, Big No No !"
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-16,1,There is a change of formulation of the product. Earlier it used to be thick but now it is quite liquidy. Change in the design of pump also which promotes wastage. The outcome of the product is also not good. The hair becomes dry. They have added a scent also now. Same is with the body wash. The quality of their products has deteriorated and cheap tactics of product wastage to promote sales is disappointing. The fact that they changed the formulation without mentioning it can be called cheating the customers. #nonethical business practices.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-13,3,What I liked :1. Plant based and minimal chemicals for baby safe usage2. No tears3. lathers well on oiled hairWhat concerned me:1. Scent is not good.Its ok2. Requires 2 washes for oiled hair to get rid of the grease completely (although I don’t go for 2nd round for my baby).3. This goes for all mama earth products: Overpriced.Just because it’s plant based /minimal chemicals.If you really want to go for 100% chemical free for your baby then you could prepare your own DIY using Fenugreek powder & curds. It’s messy a bit but 100 % safe for babies
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-06-08,4,It is a very mild shampoo. Gentle on the hair & scalp. Good for daily or alternate use. But my hair fall is still there.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-08-28,5,Very nice shampoo. Makes my baby’s hair soft and shiny with a nice light scent. I really like the ingredients in it
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-01-10,5,Good product from Mama earth. Lathers well and rinses off oil from my toddlers hair pretty easily. My daughter has curly dry hair but this one doesn't make it too dry. I tried brands like Aveeno & L'Oréal for kids but this one is far better than those. Have been using it since a year and pretty happy with the product
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-09-26,4,"I m 30 years old,, i have hair related problems from childhood,, so somebody told me to use baby shampoo,, i bought this one,, after johnsons baby shampoo,, this is good for cleaning oil,( applied one night before)from hairs in one wash,, u dont need to wash hair second time. Although it feels light burning while entering in the eyes so be careful when apply on babies. Hair becomes neither so rough nor so silky. Soso. I have dry hairs with dandruff issue. It helps in them."

My skin is smooth and supple now It definitely brightens my skin after wash and leaves no dry stretchy skin. I would recommend this product it’s good refreshing face wash.
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-01,4,It says vitamin c but it has only lemon essential oil which is not vitamin c. Vitamin c is water soluble substance which offcourse doesn't exist in lemon oil and in this product. But it is a nice facewash. Very hydrating

When I hear about Mama earth I just wanted to try once and bought coco body lotion. "" I'm surprised with the results"". When I used for the first time I don't believe it last longer but it last up to 8hrs with out oily, sticky skin, after using 4 days (daily 2 times) all cracks on my skin completely healed and became soft and healthy. Ok fragrance is good with chocolate and coffee fragrance, even I feel fragrance after 8hrs, but I get what I want for my skin"
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-12-04,4,"First impressions, lotion spreads well. Soft soothing fragrance. Hoping to see its result after use.Overall good buy during this offer.

But after applying this on my face I sweat a lot. Most importantly, the products are cruelty-free, mamearth claims that. I just have a question ""mamaearth claims that they plant a tree for every purchase so did they really plant a tree when i bought their products from amazon not from their website?""Please do answer it.I received the broken cap of the second bottle."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-12,5,"Mamaearth Ubtan Body Lotion moisturizes my skin really well. This is non-sticky yet good for this winter. I apply this product only after showering and my skin is well hydrated throughout the day. The scent is mild so doesn't bother much. It helps to even out the skin tone too. It suits for differnt skin types too, like my skin is normal whereas my sister has dry skin and she gets good result too.It's a very good product overall."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-03,5,This lotion is hands down the best I've used so far. It smells like a heavenly cup of coffee with a huge slice of delicious chocolate cake. And my skin feels super soft and healthy. Love this ❤
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-12-27,5,The fragrance is good. Mosturising stays for long hours. The tempreture here where I stay is very low and also air is dry. I mix a little of other mosturiser in it but overall it is a good product.
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-03-10,5,Smells as of cocoa and coffee. Too good. Moisturizes well

B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-03-26,4,Not enough moisturizing even though I have oily skin. The scent is quite good. But does not linger. It takes a little while to get absorbed but lasts a long time on skin.

When I hear about Mama earth I just wanted to try once and bought coco body lotion. "" I'm surprised with the results"". When I used for the first time I don't believe it last longer but it last up to 8hrs with out oily, sticky skin, after using 4 days (daily 2 times) all cracks on my skin completely healed and became soft and healthy. Ok fragrance is good with chocolate and coffee fragrance, even I feel fragrance after 8hrs, but I get what I want for my skin"

It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"

I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.

Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."

B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2021-08-06,1,This is my first purchase of mama earth brand. I was keen to experience the goodness what most people are talking about. Packaging was nice but when I use this gel form face wash my eyes burn like hell. I can't even open my eyes a bit while washing face. This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!

   Ordered this Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo on 27 November, 2019 and it was delivered on 28 November. At the time of purchase the price was 286rs.Lately i having hair fall issue and after going through a lot of reviews and recommend on this hair fall shampoo by popular youtubers decided to give it a try.Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is 100% made-up of natural materials if you going through the ingredients to get the best out of this shampoo apply onion oil or any good oil to your hair few hours before the wash no need to apply any type of other conditioner or soap just gently apply it on your hair. It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."

B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-08-12,1,"I have heard a lot about Mamaearth products and so thought of using it for my eight months old baby. This review is particularly about Mamaearth Shampoo, Everytime I applied this shampoo on my baby she used to cry inconsolably.I was sure this is a tear free shampoo and shouldn't be causing any problem , however I thought of trying it by myself for once. I was shocked only to know that it's not at all tear free and irritated my eyes like hell. Since then I am concerned how much of irritation and itching my baby has suffered because of this. I definitely won't recommend this shampoo for babies, Big No No !"
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-16,1,There is a change of formulation of the product. Earlier it used to be thick but now it is quite liquidy. Change in the design of pump also which promotes wastage. The outcome of the product is also not good. The hair becomes dry. They have added a scent also now. Same is with the body wash. The quality of their products has deteriorated and cheap tactics of product wastage to promote sales is disappointing. The fact that they changed the formulation without mentioning it can be called cheating the customers. #nonethical business practices.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-13,3,What I liked :1. Plant based and minimal chemicals for baby safe usage2. No tears3. lathers well on oiled hairWhat concerned me:1. Scent is not good.Its ok2. Requires 2 washes for oiled hair to get rid of the grease completely (although I don’t go for 2nd round for my baby).3. This goes for all mama earth products: Overpriced.Just because it’s plant based /minimal chemicals.If you really want to go for 100% chemical free for your baby then you could prepare your own DIY using Fenugreek powder & curds. It’s messy a bit but 100 % safe for babies
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-06-08,4,It is a very mild shampoo. Gentle on the hair & scalp. Good for daily or alternate use. But my hair fall is still there.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-08-28,5,Very nice shampoo. Makes my baby’s hair soft and shiny with a nice light scent. I really like the ingredients in it
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-01-10,5,Good product from Mama earth. Lathers well and rinses off oil from my toddlers hair pretty easily. My daughter has curly dry hair but this one doesn't make it too dry. I tried brands like Aveeno & L'Oréal for kids but this one is far better than those. Have been using it since a year and pretty happy with the product
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-09-26,4,"I m 30 years old,, i have hair related problems from childhood,, so somebody told me to use baby shampoo,, i bought this one,, after johnsons baby shampoo,, this is good for cleaning oil,( applied one night before)from hairs in one wash,, u dont need to wash hair second time. Although it feels light burning while entering in the eyes so be careful when apply on babies. Hair becomes neither so rough nor so silky. Soso. I have dry hairs with dandruff issue. It helps in them."
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-01-01,1,Pathetic shampoo....guys it makes the hair very very rough dry ...and on the top pathetic hairfall.....i got scared wen i saw a hundreds of hair strand fallen on my baby's tshjrt collar just after first wash and i had stopped using this shampoo there after....and hair fall had stopped soon after its use...omg plz dont make ur kid use this type of product...worthless

B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-13,3,What I liked :1. Plant based and minimal chemicals for baby safe usage2. No tears3. lathers well on oiled hairWhat concerned me:1. Scent is not good.Its ok2. Requires 2 washes for oiled hair to get rid of the grease completely (although I don’t go for 2nd round for my baby).3. This goes for all mama earth products: Overpriced.Just because it’s plant based /minimal chemicals.If you really want to go for 100% chemical free for your baby then you could prepare your own DIY using Fenugreek powder & curds. It’s messy a bit but 100 % safe for babies
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-06-08,4,It is a very mild shampoo. Gentle on the hair & scalp. Good for daily or alternate use. But my hair fall is still there.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-08-28,5,Very nice shampoo. Makes my baby’s hair soft and shiny with a nice light scent. I really like the ingredients in it
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-01-10,5,Good product from Mama earth. Lathers well and rinses off oil from my toddlers hair pretty easily. My daughter has curly dry hair but this one doesn't make it too dry. I tried brands like Aveeno & L'Oréal for kids but this one is far better than those. Have been using it since a year and pretty happy with the product
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-09-26,4,"I m 30 years old,, i have hair related problems from childhood,, so somebody told me to use baby shampoo,, i bought this one,, after johnsons baby shampoo,, this is good for cleaning oil,( applied one night before)from hairs in one wash,, u dont need to wash hair second time. Although it feels light burning while entering in the eyes so be careful when apply on babies. Hair becomes neither so rough nor so silky. Soso. I have dry hairs with dandruff issue. It helps in them."
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-01-01,1,Pathetic shampoo....guys it makes the hair very very rough dry ...and on the top pathetic hairfall.....i got scared wen i saw a hundreds of hair strand fallen on my baby's tshjrt collar just after first wash and i had stopped using this shampoo there after....and hair fall had stopped soon after its use...omg plz dont make ur kid use this type of product...worthless

B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-06-25,5,Consistency is gel like and has a light scent of orange which is refreshing I don’t mind the scent though..And I love this product after first time use. My skin is smooth and supple now It definitely brightens my skin after wash and leaves no dry stretchy skin. I would recommend this product it’s good refreshing face wash.
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-01,4,It says vitamin c but it has only lemon essential oil which is not vitamin c. Vitamin c is water soluble substance which offcourse doesn't exist in lemon oil and in this product. But it is a nice facewash. Very hydrating
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-07-02,5,This Mama Earth Vitamin C Face wash is really amazing ... it has got the benefits of Vitamin C and Turmeric .. it’s totally paraben and SLS free .. it suits all skin types .. it’s made of natural ingredients which are good for the skin .. this is truly the best Face wash I’ve ever used .. a must buy for all .. a value for money product undoubtedly!!

Otherwise you ended with darker skin on face.."
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-14,1,"Don't buy if you want your skin to be like what you've now. If you want pimples you can. I usually don't get pimples. Have oily skin, but i maintain my diet. But this product will make sure you get atleast 2 pimples. I tested it twice by not using it for few days in the middle and my skin went to normal. But when i used it again the same happened.I tested again after few months and the same result."

Packaging was nice but when I use this gel form face wash my eyes burn like hell. I can't even open my eyes a bit while washing face. This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!

B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-11-20,5,"I have dry skin, during winter my skin cracks and bleeds almost all over the body I tried different remidies and products but not satisfied with the results. When I hear about Mama earth I just wanted to try once and bought coco body lotion. "" I'm surprised with the results"". When I used for the first time I don't believe it last longer but it last up to 8hrs with out oily, sticky skin, after using 4 days (daily 2 times) all cracks on my skin completely healed and became soft and healthy. Ok fragrance is good with chocolate and coffee fragrance, even I feel fragrance after 8hrs, but I get what I want for my skin"
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-12-04,4,"First impressions, lotion spreads well. Soft soothing fragrance. Hoping to see its result after use.Overall good buy during this offer. VFM to get 2 at cost of one.Reviewing this again after 2 months usage.Texture is similar to other brands.Smell is decent.Non-greasy after use. Seeps in skin.But its effect is not long lasting. My skin becoms dry within 2 hrs time."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-06-30,5,"I got 2×400ml mamaearth rose body lotion for just rs.399. So it was a very good steal for me. The scent is okay-ish. But after applying this on my face I sweat a lot. Most importantly, the products are cruelty-free, mamearth claims that. I just have a question ""mamaearth claims that they plant a tree for every purchase so did they really plant a tree when i bought their products from amazon not from their website?""Please do answer it.I received the broken cap of the second bottle."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-12,5,"Mamaearth Ubtan Body Lotion moisturizes my skin really well. This is non-sticky yet good for this winter. I apply this product only after showering and my skin is well hydrated throughout the day. The scent is mild so doesn't bother much. It helps to even out the skin tone too. It suits for differnt skin types too, like my skin is normal whereas my sister has dry skin and she gets good result too.It's a very good product overall."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-03,5,This lotion is hands down the best I've used so far. It smells like a heavenly cup of coffee with a huge slice of delicious chocolate cake. And my skin feels super soft and healthy. Love this ❤
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-12-27,5,The fragrance is good. Mosturising stays for long hours. The tempreture here where I stay is very low and also air is dry. I mix a little of other mosturiser in it but overall it is a good product.
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-03-10,5,Smells as of cocoa and coffee. Too good. Moisturizes well
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-01-29,4,"(Mamaearth) the name is enough to explain the product... Talking about the packaging, it's nicely packed in seal poly inside and cardboard packaging outside... Just go for it.. And you will love this"

B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-03-26,4,Not enough moisturizing even though I have oily skin. The scent is quite good. But does not linger. It takes a little while to get absorbed but lasts a long time on skin.

   Ordered this Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo on 27 November, 2019 and it was delivered on 28 November. At the time of purchase the price was 286rs.Lately i having hair fall issue and after going through a lot of reviews and recommend on this hair fall shampoo by popular youtubers decided to give it a try.Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is 100% made-up of natural materials if you going through the ingredients to get the best out of this shampoo apply onion oil or any good oil to your hair few hours before the wash no need to apply any type of other conditioner or soap just gently apply it on your hair. It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,1,It's not good at all..Smell is okay and that's it. It doesn't cleanand neither removes oil from your hair.Might be okay for daily wash but not to clean wash. Don't go by the comments or rating given.Does it help in hairloss? I don't see any change even after several washes.
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-28,1,"Have order this product based on reviws and its pathetic. Vary oily,sticky. Waste of money. Just to save my comment selected 1 star but this is not a starworthy product,brand"
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-12-27,1,"i have curly frizzy hair. i tried many products but could not get softness and could not control hair fall also. hair fall happens due to internal conditions. after checking reviews for this brand product, thought of trying this product. The price is high according to me.  I lost so much hair when shampooing it self. shampoo is too sticky but after head bath hair is soft. when compared with hair loss, i stopped this product. when you are buying any product check the review dates .. if the review dates are within same time, we can ignore that product.. i tried such kind of products.. those are bad only at the end.. finally coming to this product. it is making hair shine but lost so much hair. may be this suits for only silky hair people as they don't loose so much hair while taking headbath."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-08,1,"Firstly I don't like the packaging of this shampoo.When I received the product, it was leaking.

I lost so much hair when shampooing it self. shampoo is too sticky but after head bath hair is soft. when compared with hair loss, i stopped this product. when you are buying any product check the review dates .. if the review dates are within same time, we can ignore that product.. i tried such kind of products.. those are bad only at the end.. finally coming to this product. it is making hair shine but lost so much hair. may be this suits for only silky hair people as they don't loose so much hair while taking headbath."

B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-01,4,It says vitamin c but it has only lemon essential oil which is not vitamin c. Vitamin c is water soluble substance which offcourse doesn't exist in lemon oil and in this product. But it is a nice facewash. Very hydrating

B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-14,1,"Don't buy if you want your skin to be like what you've now. If you want pimples you can. I usually don't get pimples.

B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2021-08-06,1,This is my first purchase of mama earth brand. I was keen to experience the goodness what most people are talking about.

This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!

B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-28,1,"Have order this product based on reviws and its pathetic. Vary oily,sticky. Waste of money. Just to save my comment selected 1 star but this is not a starworthy product,brand"
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-12-27,1,"i have curly frizzy hair. i tried many products but could not get softness and could not control hair fall also. hair fall happens due to internal conditions. after checking reviews for this brand product, thought of trying this product. The price is high according to me.  I lost so much hair when shampooing it self. shampoo is too sticky but after head bath hair is soft. when compared with hair loss, i stopped this product. when you are buying any product check the review dates .. if the review dates are within same time, we can ignore that product.. i tried such kind of products.. those are bad only at the end.. finally coming to this product. it is making hair shine but lost so much hair. may be this suits for only silky hair people as they don't loose so much hair while taking headbath."
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-08,1,"Firstly I don't like the packaging of this shampoo.When I received the product, it was leaking. Moreover the quantity of product in the bottle isn't visible.Upon usage I noticed that my hairfall significantly increased. It's hard to rinse off and has a very sticky and greasy texture."
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-11-12,2,"Reviews really helps to buy other people that’s why I’m always writing and I ll also buy product after read the reviews,Actually this product is not working for me , hair fall is not coming to control and falling more after start using this, and I am writing this after using 3 weeks, but it’s keeping hair soft , before this product I was used kadhi shikakai shampoo it’s control hair fall within 1 or 2 use, I’m not happy with mama earth , but I buy this after reading so many positive reviews"
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2020-11-26,5,Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is  made-up of natural ingredients its a paraben free sls free shampoo  It's  cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect.  So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive results. Overall really good product..
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-08-12,1,"I have heard a lot about Mamaearth products and so thought of using it for my eight months old baby. This review is particularly about Mamaearth Shampoo, Everytime I applied this shampoo on my baby she used to cry inconsolably.I was sure this is a tear free shampoo and shouldn't be causing any problem , however I thought of trying it by myself for once. I was shocked only to know that it's not at all tear free and irritated my eyes like hell. Since then I am concerned how much of irritation and itching my baby has suffered because of this. I definitely won't recommend this shampoo for babies, Big No No !"
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-16,1,There is a change of formulation of the product. Earlier it used to be thick but now it is quite liquidy. Change in the design of pump also which promotes wastage. The outcome of the product is also not good. The hair becomes dry. They have added a scent also now. Same is with the body wash. The quality of their products has deteriorated and cheap tactics of product wastage to promote sales is disappointing. The fact that they changed the formulation without mentioning it can be called cheating the customers. #nonethical business practices.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-13,3,What I liked :1. Plant based and minimal chemicals for baby safe usage2. No tears3. lathers well on oiled hairWhat concerned me:1. Scent is not good.Its ok2. Requires 2 washes for oiled hair to get rid of the grease completely (although I don’t go for 2nd round for my baby).3. This goes for all mama earth products: Overpriced.Just because it’s plant based /minimal chemicals.If you really want to go for 100% chemical free for your baby then you could prepare your own DIY using Fenugreek powder & curds. It’s messy a bit but 100 % safe for babies
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-06-08,4,It is a very mild shampoo. Gentle on the hair & scalp. Good for daily or alternate use. But my hair fall is still there.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-08-28,5,Very nice shampoo. Makes my baby’s hair soft and shiny with a nice light scent. I really like the ingredients in it
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-01-10,5,Good product from Mama earth. Lathers well and rinses off oil from my toddlers hair pretty easily. My daughter has curly dry hair but this one doesn't make it too dry. I tried brands like Aveeno & L'Oréal for kids but this one is far better than those. Have been using it since a year and pretty happy with the product
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-09-26,4,"I m 30 years old,, i have hair related problems from childhood,, so somebody told me to use baby shampoo,, i bought this one,, after johnsons baby shampoo,, this is good for cleaning oil,( applied one night before)from hairs in one wash,, u dont need to wash hair second time. Although it feels light burning while entering in the eyes so be careful when apply on babies. Hair becomes neither so rough nor so silky. Soso. I have dry hairs with dandruff issue. It helps in them."
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-01-01,1,Pathetic shampoo....guys it makes the hair very very rough dry ...and on the top pathetic hairfall.....i got scared wen i saw a hundreds of hair strand fallen on my baby's tshjrt collar just after first wash and i had stopped using this shampoo there after....and hair fall had stopped soon after its use...omg plz dont make ur kid use this type of product...worthless

B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-01,4,It says vitamin c but it has only lemon essential oil which is not vitamin c. Vitamin c is water soluble substance which offcourse doesn't exist in lemon oil and in this product. But it is a nice facewash. Very hydrating

But when i used it again the same happened.I tested again after few months and the same result."

This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!

When I hear about Mama earth I just wanted to try once and bought coco body lotion. "" I'm surprised with the results"". When I used for the first time I don't believe it last longer but it last up to 8hrs with out oily, sticky skin, after using 4 days (daily 2 times) all cracks on my skin completely healed and became soft and healthy. Ok fragrance is good with chocolate and coffee fragrance, even I feel fragrance after 8hrs, but I get what I want for my skin"
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-12-04,4,"First impressions, lotion spreads well. Soft soothing fragrance. Hoping to see its result after use.Overall good buy during this offer. VFM to get 2 at cost of one.Reviewing this again after 2 months usage.Texture is similar to other brands.Smell is decent.Non-greasy after use. Seeps in skin.But its effect is not long lasting. My skin becoms dry within 2 hrs time."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-06-30,5,"I got 2×400ml mamaearth rose body lotion for just rs.399. So it was a very good steal for me. The scent is okay-ish. But after applying this on my face I sweat a lot. Most importantly, the products are cruelty-free, mamearth claims that. I just have a question ""mamaearth claims that they plant a tree for every purchase so did they really plant a tree when i bought their products from amazon not from their website?""Please do answer it.I received the broken cap of the second bottle."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-12,5,"Mamaearth Ubtan Body Lotion moisturizes my skin really well. This is non-sticky yet good for this winter. I apply this product only after showering and my skin is well hydrated throughout the day. The scent is mild so doesn't bother much. It helps to even out the skin tone too. It suits for differnt skin types too, like my skin is normal whereas my sister has dry skin and she gets good result too.It's a very good product overall."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-03,5,This lotion is hands down the best I've used so far. It smells like a heavenly cup of coffee with a huge slice of delicious chocolate cake. And my skin feels super soft and healthy. Love this ❤
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-12-27,5,The fragrance is good. Mosturising stays for long hours. The tempreture here where I stay is very low and also air is dry. I mix a little of other mosturiser in it but overall it is a good product.
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-03-10,5,Smells as of cocoa and coffee. Too good. Moisturizes well
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-01-29,4,"(Mamaearth) the name is enough to explain the product... Talking about the packaging, it's nicely packed in seal poly inside and cardboard packaging outside... Just go for it.. And you will love this"

   Ordered this Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo on 27 November, 2019 and it was delivered on 28 November. At the time of purchase the price was 286rs.Lately i having hair fall issue and after going through a lot of reviews and recommend on this hair fall shampoo by popular youtubers decided to give it a try.Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is 100% made-up of natural materials if you going through the ingredients to get the best out of this shampoo apply onion oil or any good oil to your hair few hours before the wash no need to apply any type of other conditioner or soap just gently apply it on your hair. It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,1,It's not good at all..Smell is okay and that's it. It doesn't cleanand neither removes oil from your hair.Might be okay for daily wash but not to clean wash. Don't go by the comments or rating given.Does it help in hairloss? I don't see any change even after several washes.

B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,1,It's not good at all..Smell is okay and that's it. It doesn't cleanand neither removes oil from your hair.Might be okay for daily wash but not to clean wash. Don't go by the comments or rating given.Does it help in hairloss? I don't see any change even after several washes.
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-28,1,"Have order this product based on reviws and its pathetic. Vary oily,sticky. Waste of money. Just to save my comment selected 1 star but this is not a starworthy product,brand"
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-12-27,1,"i have curly frizzy hair. i tried many products but could not get softness and could not control hair fall also. hair fall happens due to internal conditions. after checking reviews for this brand product, thought of trying this product. The price is high according to me.  I lost so much hair when shampooing it self. shampoo is too sticky but after head bath hair is soft. when compared with hair loss, i stopped this product. when you are buying any product check the review dates .. if the review dates are within same time, we can ignore that product.. i tried such kind of products.. those are bad only at the end.. finally coming to this product. it is making hair shine but lost so much hair. may be this suits for only silky hair people as they don't loose so much hair while taking headbath."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-08,1,"Firstly I don't like the packaging of this shampoo.When I received the product, it was leaking. Moreover the quantity of product in the bottle isn't visible.Upon usage I noticed that my hairfall significantly increased. It's hard to rinse off and has a very sticky and greasy texture."

B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-01,4,It says vitamin c but it has only lemon essential oil which is not vitamin c. Vitamin c is water soluble substance which offcourse doesn't exist in lemon oil and in this product. But it is a nice facewash. Very hydrating

Packaging was nice but when I use this gel form face wash my eyes burn like hell. I can't even open my eyes a bit while washing face. This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!

B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,1,It's not good at all..Smell is okay and that's it. It doesn't cleanand neither removes oil from your hair.Might be okay for daily wash but not to clean wash. Don't go by the comments or rating given.Does it help in hairloss? I don't see any change even after several washes.
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-28,1,"Have order this product based on reviws and its pathetic. Vary oily,sticky. Waste of money. Just to save my comment selected 1 star but this is not a starworthy product,brand"

This review is particularly about Mamaearth Shampoo, Everytime I applied this shampoo on my baby she used to cry inconsolably.I was sure this is a tear free shampoo and shouldn't be causing any problem , however I thought of trying it by myself for once. I was shocked only to know that it's not at all tear free and irritated my eyes like hell. Since then I am concerned how much of irritation and itching my baby has suffered because of this. I definitely won't recommend this shampoo for babies, Big No No !"
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-16,1,There is a change of formulation of the product. Earlier it used to be thick but now it is quite liquidy. Change in the design of pump also which promotes wastage. The outcome of the product is also not good. The hair becomes dry. They have added a scent also now. Same is with the body wash. The quality of their products has deteriorated and cheap tactics of product wastage to promote sales is disappointing. The fact that they changed the formulation without mentioning it can be called cheating the customers. #nonethical business practices.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-13,3,What I liked :1. Plant based and minimal chemicals for baby safe usage2. No tears3. lathers well on oiled hairWhat concerned me:1. Scent is not good.Its ok2. Requires 2 washes for oiled hair to get rid of the grease completely (although I don’t go for 2nd round for my baby).3. This goes for all mama earth products: Overpriced.Just because it’s plant based /minimal chemicals.If you really want to go for 100% chemical free for your baby then you could prepare your own DIY using Fenugreek powder & curds. It’s messy a bit but 100 % safe for babies
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-06-08,4,It is a very mild shampoo. Gentle on the hair & scalp. Good for daily or alternate use. But my hair fall is still there.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-08-28,5,Very nice shampoo. Makes my baby’s hair soft and shiny with a nice light scent. I really like the ingredients in it
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-01-10,5,Good product from Mama earth. Lathers well and rinses off oil from my toddlers hair pretty easily. My daughter has curly dry hair but this one doesn't make it too dry. I tried brands like Aveeno & L'Oréal for kids but this one is far better than those. Have been using it since a year and pretty happy with the product
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-09-26,4,"I m 30 years old,, i have hair related problems from childhood,, so somebody told me to use baby shampoo,, i bought this one,, after johnsons baby shampoo,, this is good for cleaning oil,( applied one night before)from hairs in one wash,, u dont need to wash hair second time. Although it feels light burning while entering in the eyes so be careful when apply on babies. Hair becomes neither so rough nor so silky. Soso. I have dry hairs with dandruff issue. It helps in them."
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-01-01,1,Pathetic shampoo....guys it makes the hair very very rough dry ...and on the top pathetic hairfall.....i got scared wen i saw a hundreds of hair strand fallen on my baby's tshjrt collar just after first wash and i had stopped using this shampoo there after....and hair fall had stopped soon after its use...omg plz dont make ur kid use this type of product...worthless
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2017-10-29,5,This is a fabulous product having the quality as expected . It is worth the price. I appreciate the out of the box experience given by the manufacturer and the service of Amazon. Thank you Amazon.

B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-01-10,5,Good product from Mama earth. Lathers well and rinses off oil from my toddlers hair pretty easily. My daughter has curly dry hair but this one doesn't make it too dry. I tried brands like Aveeno & L'Oréal for kids but this one is far better than those. Have been using it since a year and pretty happy with the product
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-09-26,4,"I m 30 years old,, i have hair related problems from childhood,, so somebody told me to use baby shampoo,, i bought this one,, after johnsons baby shampoo,, this is good for cleaning oil,( applied one night before)from hairs in one wash,, u dont need to wash hair second time. Although it feels light burning while entering in the eyes so be careful when apply on babies. Hair becomes neither so rough nor so silky. Soso. I have dry hairs with dandruff issue. It helps in them."
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-01-01,1,Pathetic shampoo....guys it makes the hair very very rough dry ...and on the top pathetic hairfall.....i got scared wen i saw a hundreds of hair strand fallen on my baby's tshjrt collar just after first wash and i had stopped using this shampoo there after....and hair fall had stopped soon after its use...omg plz dont make ur kid use this type of product...worthless

B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-06-25,5,Consistency is gel like and has a light scent of orange which is refreshing I don’t mind the scent though..And I love this product after first time use. My skin is smooth and supple now It definitely brightens my skin after wash and leaves no dry stretchy skin. I would recommend this product it’s good refreshing face wash.
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-01,4,It says vitamin c but it has only lemon essential oil which is not vitamin c. Vitamin c is water soluble substance which offcourse doesn't exist in lemon oil and in this product. But it is a nice facewash. Very hydrating

But when i used it again the same happened.I tested again after few months and the same result."

This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!

   Ordered this Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo on 27 November, 2019 and it was delivered on 28 November. At the time of purchase the price was 286rs.Lately i having hair fall issue and after going through a lot of reviews and recommend on this hair fall shampoo by popular youtubers decided to give it a try.Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is 100% made-up of natural materials if you going through the ingredients to get the best out of this shampoo apply onion oil or any good oil to your hair few hours before the wash no need to apply any type of other conditioner or soap just gently apply it on your hair. It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,1,It's not good at all..Smell is okay and that's it. It doesn't cleanand neither removes oil from your hair.Might be okay for daily wash but not to clean wash. Don't go by the comments or rating given.Does it help in hairloss? I don't see any change even after several washes.
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-28,1,"Have order this product based on reviws and its pathetic. Vary oily,sticky. Waste of money. Just to save my comment selected 1 star but this is not a starworthy product,brand"
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-12-27,1,"i have curly frizzy hair. i tried many products but could not get softness and could not control hair fall also. hair fall happens due to internal conditions. after checking reviews for this brand product, thought of trying this product. The price is high according to me.  I lost so much hair when shampooing it self. shampoo is too sticky but after head bath hair is soft. when compared with hair loss, i stopped this product. when you are buying any product check the review dates .. if the review dates are within same time, we can ignore that product.. i tried such kind of products.. those are bad only at the end.. finally coming to this product. it is making hair shine but lost so much hair. may be this suits for only silky hair people as they don't loose so much hair while taking headbath."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-08,1,"Firstly I don't like the packaging of this shampoo.When I received the product, it was leaking. Moreover the quantity of product in the bottle isn't visible.Upon usage I noticed that my hairfall significantly increased. It's hard to rinse off and has a very sticky and greasy texture."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-11-12,2,"Reviews really helps to buy other people that’s why I’m always writing and I ll also buy product after read the reviews,Actually this product is not working for me , hair fall is not coming to control and falling more after start using this, and I am writing this after using 3 weeks, but it’s keeping hair soft , before this product I was used kadhi shikakai shampoo it’s control hair fall within 1 or 2 use, I’m not happy with mama earth , but I buy this after reading so many positive reviews"
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2020-11-26,5,Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is  made-up of natural ingredients its a paraben free sls free shampoo  It's  cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect.  So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive results. Overall really good product..

B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,1,It's not good at all..Smell is okay and that's it.

It has no added chemicals to it and good for both men and women and suitable for sensitive skin also as it has turmeric in it. One should try this amaing product.
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-06-25,5,Consistency is gel like and has a light scent of orange which is refreshing I don’t mind the scent though..And I love this product after first time use. My skin is smooth and supple now It definitely brightens my skin after wash and leaves no dry stretchy skin. I would recommend this product it’s good refreshing face wash.
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-01,4,It says vitamin c but it has only lemon essential oil which is not vitamin c. Vitamin c is water soluble substance which offcourse doesn't exist in lemon oil and in this product. But it is a nice facewash. Very hydrating
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-07-02,5,This Mama Earth Vitamin C Face wash is really amazing ... it has got the benefits of Vitamin C and Turmeric .. it’s totally paraben and SLS free .. it suits all skin types .. it’s made of natural ingredients which are good for the skin .. this is truly the best Face wash I’ve ever used .. a must buy for all .. a value for money product undoubtedly!!
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-05,1,"Don't believe positive reviews of this product...Whoever said in negative reviews are genuine..I too experienced same as like negative comments..In single wash, my face became too darker than before..I was shocked after seeing the results....I was purchased by believing all positive comments..Have doubt on ingredients ..Please don't purchase this product.. Otherwise you ended with darker skin on face.."
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-14,1,"Don't buy if you want your skin to be like what you've now. If you want pimples you can. I usually don't get pimples. Have oily skin, but i maintain my diet. But this product will make sure you get atleast 2 pimples. I tested it twice by not using it for few days in the middle and my skin went to normal. But when i used it again the same happened.I tested again after few months and the same result."
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-11-21,1,"This was for my son to wash his face if he kept the face wash on his hand for about 5 minutes his hands got super dry and skin coming out. I don't recommend this product. It's not the first time, the quality of cosmetics on Amazon is not good,  you get many fake products.  It's not the way amazon gives their products to customers"
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2021-08-06,1,This is my first purchase of mama earth brand. I was keen to experience the goodness what most people are talking about. Packaging was nice but when I use this gel form face wash my eyes burn like hell. I can't even open my eyes a bit while washing face. This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-02,4,"I was looking for a mild facewash ;mamaearth is a good choice it doesn't harm your skin because no sulphates and parabeanThings I like about this productIt have a plasent smellIt have active vitamin CIt suits for all skin typesCruelty freeAffordable priceOne thing I don't like about this,they are written on their package it promotes even skin tone, I believe that face wash is not for whitening the face otherwise I like all about this product."
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2021-02-11,5,The product is very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very nice product

It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,1,It's not good at all..Smell is okay and that's it.

I don't see any change even after several washes.

B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-08-12,1,"I have heard a lot about Mamaearth products and so thought of using it for my eight months old baby. This review is particularly about Mamaearth Shampoo, Everytime I applied this shampoo on my baby she used to cry inconsolably.I was sure this is a tear free shampoo and shouldn't be causing any problem , however I thought of trying it by myself for once. I was shocked only to know that it's not at all tear free and irritated my eyes like hell. Since then I am concerned how much of irritation and itching my baby has suffered because of this. I definitely won't recommend this shampoo for babies, Big No No !"
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-16,1,There is a change of formulation of the product. Earlier it used to be thick but now it is quite liquidy. Change in the design of pump also which promotes wastage. The outcome of the product is also not good. The hair becomes dry. They have added a scent also now. Same is with the body wash. The quality of their products has deteriorated and cheap tactics of product wastage to promote sales is disappointing. The fact that they changed the formulation without mentioning it can be called cheating the customers. #nonethical business practices.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-13,3,What I liked :1. Plant based and minimal chemicals for baby safe usage2. No tears3. lathers well on oiled hairWhat concerned me:1. Scent is not good.Its ok2. Requires 2 washes for oiled hair to get rid of the grease completely (although I don’t go for 2nd round for my baby).3. This goes for all mama earth products: Overpriced.Just because it’s plant based /minimal chemicals.If you really want to go for 100% chemical free for your baby then you could prepare your own DIY using Fenugreek powder & curds. It’s messy a bit but 100 % safe for babies
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-06-08,4,It is a very mild shampoo. Gentle on the hair & scalp. Good for daily or alternate use. But my hair fall is still there.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-08-28,5,Very nice shampoo. Makes my baby’s hair soft and shiny with a nice light scent. I really like the ingredients in it
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-01-10,5,Good product from Mama earth. Lathers well and rinses off oil from my toddlers hair pretty easily. My daughter has curly dry hair but this one doesn't make it too dry. I tried brands like Aveeno & L'Oréal for kids but this one is far better than those. Have been using it since a year and pretty happy with the product
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-09-26,4,"I m 30 years old,, i have hair related problems from childhood,, so somebody told me to use baby shampoo,, i bought this one,, after johnsons baby shampoo,, this is good for cleaning oil,( applied one night before)from hairs in one wash,, u dont need to wash hair second time. Although it feels light burning while entering in the eyes so be careful when apply on babies. Hair becomes neither so rough nor so silky. Soso. I have dry hairs with dandruff issue. It helps in them."

B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-08-12,1,"I have heard a lot about Mamaearth products and so thought of using it for my eight months old baby. This review is particularly about Mamaearth Shampoo, Everytime I applied this shampoo on my baby she used to cry inconsolably.I was sure this is a tear free shampoo and shouldn't be causing any problem , however I thought of trying it by myself for once. I was shocked only to know that it's not at all tear free and irritated my eyes like hell. Since then I am concerned how much of irritation and itching my baby has suffered because of this. I definitely won't recommend this shampoo for babies, Big No No !"
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-16,1,There is a change of formulation of the product. Earlier it used to be thick but now it is quite liquidy. Change in the design of pump also which promotes wastage. The outcome of the product is also not good. The hair becomes dry. They have added a scent also now. Same is with the body wash. The quality of their products has deteriorated and cheap tactics of product wastage to promote sales is disappointing. The fact that they changed the formulation without mentioning it can be called cheating the customers. #nonethical business practices.

B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-06-25,5,Consistency is gel like and has a light scent of orange which is refreshing I don’t mind the scent though..And I love this product after first time use. My skin is smooth and supple now It definitely brightens my skin after wash and leaves no dry stretchy skin. I would recommend this product it’s good refreshing face wash.
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-01,4,It says vitamin c but it has only lemon essential oil which is not vitamin c. Vitamin c is water soluble substance which offcourse doesn't exist in lemon oil and in this product. But it is a nice facewash. Very hydrating

I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!

When I hear about Mama earth I just wanted to try once and bought coco body lotion. "" I'm surprised with the results"". When I used for the first time I don't believe it last longer but it last up to 8hrs with out oily, sticky skin, after using 4 days (daily 2 times) all cracks on my skin completely healed and became soft and healthy. Ok fragrance is good with chocolate and coffee fragrance, even I feel fragrance after 8hrs, but I get what I want for my skin"
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-12-04,4,"First impressions, lotion spreads well. Soft soothing fragrance. Hoping to see its result after use.Overall good buy during this offer. VFM to get 2 at cost of one.Reviewing this again after 2 months usage.Texture is similar to other brands.Smell is decent.Non-greasy after use. Seeps in skin.But its effect is not long lasting. My skin becoms dry within 2 hrs time."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-06-30,5,"I got 2×400ml mamaearth rose body lotion for just rs.399. So it was a very good steal for me. The scent is okay-ish. But after applying this on my face I sweat a lot. Most importantly, the products are cruelty-free, mamearth claims that. I just have a question ""mamaearth claims that they plant a tree for every purchase so did they really plant a tree when i bought their products from amazon not from their website?""Please do answer it.I received the broken cap of the second bottle."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-12,5,"Mamaearth Ubtan Body Lotion moisturizes my skin really well. This is non-sticky yet good for this winter. I apply this product only after showering and my skin is well hydrated throughout the day. The scent is mild so doesn't bother much. It helps to even out the skin tone too. It suits for differnt skin types too, like my skin is normal whereas my sister has dry skin and she gets good result too.It's a very good product overall."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-03,5,This lotion is hands down the best I've used so far. It smells like a heavenly cup of coffee with a huge slice of delicious chocolate cake. And my skin feels super soft and healthy. Love this ❤
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-12-27,5,The fragrance is good. Mosturising stays for long hours. The tempreture here where I stay is very low and also air is dry. I mix a little of other mosturiser in it but overall it is a good product.
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-03-10,5,Smells as of cocoa and coffee. Too good. Moisturizes well

B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-03-26,4,Not enough moisturizing even though I have oily skin. The scent is quite good. But does not linger. It takes a little while to get absorbed but lasts a long time on skin.

B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-12-04,4,"First impressions, lotion spreads well. Soft soothing fragrance. Hoping to see its result after use.Overall good buy during this offer. VFM to get 2 at cost of one.Reviewing this again after 2 months usage.Texture is similar to other brands.Smell is decent.Non-greasy after use. Seeps in skin.But its effect is not long lasting. My skin becoms dry within 2 hrs time."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-06-30,5,"I got 2×400ml mamaearth rose body lotion for just rs.399. So it was a very good steal for me. The scent is okay-ish. But after applying this on my face I sweat a lot. Most importantly, the products are cruelty-free, mamearth claims that. I just have a question ""mamaearth claims that they plant a tree for every purchase so did they really plant a tree when i bought their products from amazon not from their website?""Please do answer it.I received the broken cap of the second bottle."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-12,5,"Mamaearth Ubtan Body Lotion moisturizes my skin really well. This is non-sticky yet good for this winter. I apply this product only after showering and my skin is well hydrated throughout the day. The scent is mild so doesn't bother much. It helps to even out the skin tone too. It suits for differnt skin types too, like my skin is normal whereas my sister has dry skin and she gets good result too.It's a very good product overall."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-03,5,This lotion is hands down the best I've used so far. It smells like a heavenly cup of coffee with a huge slice of delicious chocolate cake. And my skin feels super soft and healthy. Love this ❤
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-12-27,5,The fragrance is good. Mosturising stays for long hours. The tempreture here where I stay is very low and also air is dry. I mix a little of other mosturiser in it but overall it is a good product.
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-03-10,5,Smells as of cocoa and coffee. Too good. Moisturizes well
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-01-29,4,"(Mamaearth) the name is enough to explain the product... Talking about the packaging, it's nicely packed in seal poly inside and cardboard packaging outside... Just go for it.. And you will love this"

   I liked it♥️The product is soooo good👍U can also try to buy this"
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-03-26,4,Not enough moisturizing even though I have oily skin. The scent is quite good. But does not linger. It takes a little while to get absorbed but lasts a long time on skin.

   Ordered this Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo on 27 November, 2019 and it was delivered on 28 November. At the time of purchase the price was 286rs.Lately i having hair fall issue and after going through a lot of reviews and recommend on this hair fall shampoo by popular youtubers decided to give it a try.Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is 100% made-up of natural materials if you going through the ingredients to get the best out of this shampoo apply onion oil or any good oil to your hair few hours before the wash no need to apply any type of other conditioner or soap just gently apply it on your hair. It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,1,It's not good at all..Smell is okay and that's it.

I don't see any change even after several washes.

B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-01,4,It says vitamin c but it has only lemon essential oil which is not vitamin c. Vitamin c is water soluble substance which offcourse doesn't exist in lemon oil and in this product. But it is a nice facewash. Very hydrating

B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-14,1,"Don't buy if you want your skin to be like what you've now. If you want pimples you can. I usually don't get pimples.

Packaging was nice but when I use this gel form face wash my eyes burn like hell. I can't even open my eyes a bit while washing face. This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!

It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"

The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight.

I lost so much hair when shampooing it self. shampoo is too sticky but after head bath hair is soft. when compared with hair loss, i stopped this product. when you are buying any product check the review dates .. if the review dates are within same time, we can ignore that product.. i tried such kind of products.. those are bad only at the end.. finally coming to this product. it is making hair shine but lost so much hair. may be this suits for only silky hair people as they don't loose so much hair while taking headbath."
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-08,1,"Firstly I don't like the packaging of this shampoo.When I received the product, it was leaking. Moreover the quantity of product in the bottle isn't visible.Upon usage I noticed that my hairfall significantly increased. It's hard to rinse off and has a very sticky and greasy texture."
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-11-12,2,"Reviews really helps to buy other people that’s why I’m always writing and I ll also buy product after read the reviews,Actually this product is not working for me , hair fall is not coming to control and falling more after start using this, and I am writing this after using 3 weeks, but it’s keeping hair soft , before this product I was used kadhi shikakai shampoo it’s control hair fall within 1 or 2 use, I’m not happy with mama earth , but I buy this after reading so many positive reviews"
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2020-11-26,5,Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is  made-up of natural ingredients its a paraben free sls free shampoo  It's  cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect.  So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive results. Overall really good product..
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-08-12,1,"I have heard a lot about Mamaearth products and so thought of using it for my eight months old baby. This review is particularly about Mamaearth Shampoo, Everytime I applied this shampoo on my baby she used to cry inconsolably.I was sure this is a tear free shampoo and shouldn't be causing any problem , however I thought of trying it by myself for once. I was shocked only to know that it's not at all tear free and irritated my eyes like hell. Since then I am concerned how much of irritation and itching my baby has suffered because of this. I definitely won't recommend this shampoo for babies, Big No No !"
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-16,1,There is a change of formulation of the product. Earlier it used to be thick but now it is quite liquidy. Change in the design of pump also which promotes wastage. The outcome of the product is also not good. The hair becomes dry. They have added a scent also now. Same is with the body wash. The quality of their products has deteriorated and cheap tactics of product wastage to promote sales is disappointing. The fact that they changed the formulation without mentioning it can be called cheating the customers. #nonethical business practices.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-13,3,What I liked :1. Plant based and minimal chemicals for baby safe usage2. No tears3. lathers well on oiled hairWhat concerned me:1. Scent is not good.Its ok2. Requires 2 washes for oiled hair to get rid of the grease completely (although I don’t go for 2nd round for my baby).3. This goes for all mama earth products: Overpriced.Just because it’s plant based /minimal chemicals.If you really want to go for 100% chemical free for your baby then you could prepare your own DIY using Fenugreek powder & curds. It’s messy a bit but 100 % safe for babies
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-06-08,4,It is a very mild shampoo. Gentle on the hair & scalp. Good for daily or alternate use. But my hair fall is still there.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-08-28,5,Very nice shampoo. Makes my baby’s hair soft and shiny with a nice light scent. I really like the ingredients in it
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-01-10,5,Good product from Mama earth. Lathers well and rinses off oil from my toddlers hair pretty easily. My daughter has curly dry hair but this one doesn't make it too dry. I tried brands like Aveeno & L'Oréal for kids but this one is far better than those. Have been using it since a year and pretty happy with the product
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-09-26,4,"I m 30 years old,, i have hair related problems from childhood,, so somebody told me to use baby shampoo,, i bought this one,, after johnsons baby shampoo,, this is good for cleaning oil,( applied one night before)from hairs in one wash,, u dont need to wash hair second time. Although it feels light burning while entering in the eyes so be careful when apply on babies. Hair becomes neither so rough nor so silky. Soso. I have dry hairs with dandruff issue. It helps in them."

My skin is smooth and supple now It definitely brightens my skin after wash and leaves no dry stretchy skin. I would recommend this product it’s good refreshing face wash.
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-01,4,It says vitamin c but it has only lemon essential oil which is not vitamin c. Vitamin c is water soluble substance which offcourse doesn't exist in lemon oil and in this product. But it is a nice facewash. Very hydrating

When I hear about Mama earth I just wanted to try once and bought coco body lotion. "" I'm surprised with the results"". When I used for the first time I don't believe it last longer but it last up to 8hrs with out oily, sticky skin, after using 4 days (daily 2 times) all cracks on my skin completely healed and became soft and healthy. Ok fragrance is good with chocolate and coffee fragrance, even I feel fragrance after 8hrs, but I get what I want for my skin"
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-12-04,4,"First impressions, lotion spreads well. Soft soothing fragrance. Hoping to see its result after use.Overall good buy during this offer. VFM to get 2 at cost of one.Reviewing this again after 2 months usage.Texture is similar to other brands.Smell is decent.Non-greasy after use. Seeps in skin.But its effect is not long lasting. My skin becoms dry within 2 hrs time."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-06-30,5,"I got 2×400ml mamaearth rose body lotion for just rs.399. So it was a very good steal for me. The scent is okay-ish. But after applying this on my face I sweat a lot. Most importantly, the products are cruelty-free, mamearth claims that. I just have a question ""mamaearth claims that they plant a tree for every purchase so did they really plant a tree when i bought their products from amazon not from their website?""Please do answer it.I received the broken cap of the second bottle."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-12,5,"Mamaearth Ubtan Body Lotion moisturizes my skin really well. This is non-sticky yet good for this winter. I apply this product only after showering and my skin is well hydrated throughout the day. The scent is mild so doesn't bother much. It helps to even out the skin tone too. It suits for differnt skin types too, like my skin is normal whereas my sister has dry skin and she gets good result too.It's a very good product overall."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-03,5,This lotion is hands down the best I've used so far. It smells like a heavenly cup of coffee with a huge slice of delicious chocolate cake. And my skin feels super soft and healthy. Love this ❤
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-12-27,5,The fragrance is good. Mosturising stays for long hours. The tempreture here where I stay is very low and also air is dry. I mix a little of other mosturiser in it but overall it is a good product.
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-03-10,5,Smells as of cocoa and coffee. Too good. Moisturizes well
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-01-29,4,"(Mamaearth) the name is enough to explain the product... Talking about the packaging, it's nicely packed in seal poly inside and cardboard packaging outside... Just go for it.. And you will love this"

   I liked it♥️The product is soooo good👍U can also try to buy this"
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-03-26,4,Not enough moisturizing even though I have oily skin. The scent is quite good. But does not linger. It takes a little while to get absorbed but lasts a long time on skin.

   Ordered this Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo on 27 November, 2019 and it was delivered on 28 November. At the time of purchase the price was 286rs.Lately i having hair fall issue and after going through a lot of reviews and recommend on this hair fall shampoo by popular youtubers decided to give it a try.Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is 100% made-up of natural materials if you going through the ingredients to get the best out of this shampoo apply onion oil or any good oil to your hair few hours before the wash no need to apply any type of other conditioner or soap just gently apply it on your hair. It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,1,It's not good at all..Smell is okay and that's it.

I don't see any change even after several washes.

Otherwise you ended with darker skin on face.."
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-14,1,"Don't buy if you want your skin to be like what you've now. If you want pimples you can. I usually don't get pimples. Have oily skin, but i maintain my diet. But this product will make sure you get atleast 2 pimples. I tested it twice by not using it for few days in the middle and my skin went to normal. But when i used it again the same happened.I tested again after few months and the same result."

B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2021-08-06,1,This is my first purchase of mama earth brand. I was keen to experience the goodness what most people are talking about. Packaging was nice but when I use this gel form face wash my eyes burn like hell. I can't even open my eyes a bit while washing face. This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!

B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-06-25,5,Consistency is gel like and has a light scent of orange which is refreshing I don’t mind the scent though..And I love this product after first time use.

It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"

The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight.

B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-08,1,"Firstly I don't like the packaging of this shampoo.When I received the product, it was leaking. Moreover the quantity of product in the bottle isn't visible.Upon usage I noticed that my hairfall significantly increased. It's hard to rinse off and has a very sticky and greasy texture."
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-11-12,2,"Reviews really helps to buy other people that’s why I’m always writing and I ll also buy product after read the reviews,Actually this product is not working for me , hair fall is not coming to control and falling more after start using this, and I am writing this after using 3 weeks, but it’s keeping hair soft , before this product I was used kadhi shikakai shampoo it’s control hair fall within 1 or 2 use, I’m not happy with mama earth , but I buy this after reading so many positive reviews"
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2020-11-26,5,Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is  made-up of natural ingredients its a paraben free sls free shampoo  It's  cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect.  So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive results. Overall really good product..
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-08-12,1,"I have heard a lot about Mamaearth products and so thought of using it for my eight months old baby. This review is particularly about Mamaearth Shampoo, Everytime I applied this shampoo on my baby she used to cry inconsolably.I was sure this is a tear free shampoo and shouldn't be causing any problem , however I thought of trying it by myself for once. I was shocked only to know that it's not at all tear free and irritated my eyes like hell. Since then I am concerned how much of irritation and itching my baby has suffered because of this. I definitely won't recommend this shampoo for babies, Big No No !"
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-16,1,There is a change of formulation of the product. Earlier it used to be thick but now it is quite liquidy. Change in the design of pump also which promotes wastage. The outcome of the product is also not good. The hair becomes dry. They have added a scent also now. Same is with the body wash. The quality of their products has deteriorated and cheap tactics of product wastage to promote sales is disappointing. The fact that they changed the formulation without mentioning it can be called cheating the customers. #nonethical business practices.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-13,3,What I liked :1. Plant based and minimal chemicals for baby safe usage2. No tears3. lathers well on oiled hairWhat concerned me:1. Scent is not good.Its ok2. Requires 2 washes for oiled hair to get rid of the grease completely (although I don’t go for 2nd round for my baby).3. This goes for all mama earth products: Overpriced.Just because it’s plant based /minimal chemicals.If you really want to go for 100% chemical free for your baby then you could prepare your own DIY using Fenugreek powder & curds. It’s messy a bit but 100 % safe for babies
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-06-08,4,It is a very mild shampoo. Gentle on the hair & scalp. Good for daily or alternate use. But my hair fall is still there.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-08-28,5,Very nice shampoo. Makes my baby’s hair soft and shiny with a nice light scent. I really like the ingredients in it
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-01-10,5,Good product from Mama earth. Lathers well and rinses off oil from my toddlers hair pretty easily. My daughter has curly dry hair but this one doesn't make it too dry. I tried brands like Aveeno & L'Oréal for kids but this one is far better than those. Have been using it since a year and pretty happy with the product
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-09-26,4,"I m 30 years old,, i have hair related problems from childhood,, so somebody told me to use baby shampoo,, i bought this one,, after johnsons baby shampoo,, this is good for cleaning oil,( applied one night before)from hairs in one wash,, u dont need to wash hair second time. Although it feels light burning while entering in the eyes so be careful when apply on babies. Hair becomes neither so rough nor so silky. Soso. I have dry hairs with dandruff issue. It helps in them."

B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-06-25,5,Consistency is gel like and has a light scent of orange which is refreshing I don’t mind the scent though..And I love this product after first time use. My skin is smooth and supple now It definitely brightens my skin after wash and leaves no dry stretchy skin. I would recommend this product it’s good refreshing face wash.
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-01,4,It says vitamin c but it has only lemon essential oil which is not vitamin c. Vitamin c is water soluble substance which offcourse doesn't exist in lemon oil and in this product. But it is a nice facewash. Very hydrating
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-07-02,5,This Mama Earth Vitamin C Face wash is really amazing ... it has got the benefits of Vitamin C and Turmeric .. it’s totally paraben and SLS free .. it suits all skin types .. it’s made of natural ingredients which are good for the skin .. this is truly the best Face wash I’ve ever used .. a must buy for all .. a value for money product undoubtedly!!

But when i used it again the same happened.I tested again after few months and the same result."

This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!

I apply this product only after showering and my skin is well hydrated throughout the day. The scent is mild so doesn't bother much. It helps to even out the skin tone too. It suits for differnt skin types too, like my skin is normal whereas my sister has dry skin and she gets good result too.It's a very good product overall."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-03,5,This lotion is hands down the best I've used so far. It smells like a heavenly cup of coffee with a huge slice of delicious chocolate cake. And my skin feels super soft and healthy. Love this ❤
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-12-27,5,The fragrance is good. Mosturising stays for long hours. The tempreture here where I stay is very low and also air is dry. I mix a little of other mosturiser in it but overall it is a good product.

B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-12,5,"Mamaearth Ubtan Body Lotion moisturizes my skin really well. This is non-sticky yet good for this winter. I apply this product only after showering and my skin is well hydrated throughout the day. The scent is mild so doesn't bother much. It helps to even out the skin tone too. It suits for differnt skin types too, like my skin is normal whereas my sister has dry skin and she gets good result too.It's a very good product overall."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-03,5,This lotion is hands down the best I've used so far. It smells like a heavenly cup of coffee with a huge slice of delicious chocolate cake. And my skin feels super soft and healthy. Love this ❤
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-12-27,5,The fragrance is good. Mosturising stays for long hours. The tempreture here where I stay is very low and also air is dry. I mix a little of other mosturiser in it but overall it is a good product.
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-03-10,5,Smells as of cocoa and coffee. Too good. Moisturizes well
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-01-29,4,"(Mamaearth) the name is enough to explain the product... Talking about the packaging, it's nicely packed in seal poly inside and cardboard packaging outside... Just go for it.. And you will love this"

   I liked it♥️The product is soooo good👍U can also try to buy this"
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-03-26,4,Not enough moisturizing even though I have oily skin. The scent is quite good. But does not linger. It takes a little while to get absorbed but lasts a long time on skin.

   Ordered this Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo on 27 November, 2019 and it was delivered on 28 November. At the time of purchase the price was 286rs.Lately i having hair fall issue and after going through a lot of reviews and recommend on this hair fall shampoo by popular youtubers decided to give it a try.Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is 100% made-up of natural materials if you going through the ingredients to get the best out of this shampoo apply onion oil or any good oil to your hair few hours before the wash no need to apply any type of other conditioner or soap just gently apply it on your hair. It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,1,It's not good at all..Smell is okay and that's it.

I don't see any change even after several washes.

Packaging was nice but when I use this gel form face wash my eyes burn like hell. I can't even open my eyes a bit while washing face. This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!

   Ordered this Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo on 27 November, 2019 and it was delivered on 28 November. At the time of purchase the price was 286rs.Lately i having hair fall issue and after going through a lot of reviews and recommend on this hair fall shampoo by popular youtubers decided to give it a try.Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is 100% made-up of natural materials if you going through the ingredients to get the best out of this shampoo apply onion oil or any good oil to your hair few hours before the wash no need to apply any type of other conditioner or soap just gently apply it on your hair. It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.

Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."

Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."

B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight.

This review is particularly about Mamaearth Shampoo, Everytime I applied this shampoo on my baby she used to cry inconsolably.I was sure this is a tear free shampoo and shouldn't be causing any problem , however I thought of trying it by myself for once. I was shocked only to know that it's not at all tear free and irritated my eyes like hell. Since then I am concerned how much of irritation and itching my baby has suffered because of this. I definitely won't recommend this shampoo for babies, Big No No !"
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-16,1,There is a change of formulation of the product. Earlier it used to be thick but now it is quite liquidy. Change in the design of pump also which promotes wastage. The outcome of the product is also not good. The hair becomes dry. They have added a scent also now. Same is with the body wash. The quality of their products has deteriorated and cheap tactics of product wastage to promote sales is disappointing. The fact that they changed the formulation without mentioning it can be called cheating the customers. #nonethical business practices.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-13,3,What I liked :1. Plant based and minimal chemicals for baby safe usage2. No tears3. lathers well on oiled hairWhat concerned me:1. Scent is not good.Its ok2. Requires 2 washes for oiled hair to get rid of the grease completely (although I don’t go for 2nd round for my baby).3. This goes for all mama earth products: Overpriced.Just because it’s plant based /minimal chemicals.If you really want to go for 100% chemical free for your baby then you could prepare your own DIY using Fenugreek powder & curds. It’s messy a bit but 100 % safe for babies
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-06-08,4,It is a very mild shampoo. Gentle on the hair & scalp. Good for daily or alternate use. But my hair fall is still there.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-08-28,5,Very nice shampoo. Makes my baby’s hair soft and shiny with a nice light scent. I really like the ingredients in it
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-01-10,5,Good product from Mama earth. Lathers well and rinses off oil from my toddlers hair pretty easily. My daughter has curly dry hair but this one doesn't make it too dry. I tried brands like Aveeno & L'Oréal for kids but this one is far better than those. Have been using it since a year and pretty happy with the product

Although it feels light burning while entering in the eyes so be careful when apply on babies. Hair becomes neither so rough nor so silky. Soso. I have dry hairs with dandruff issue. It helps in them."

B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-06-25,5,Consistency is gel like and has a light scent of orange which is refreshing I don’t mind the scent though..And I love this product after first time use. My skin is smooth and supple now It definitely brightens my skin after wash and leaves no dry stretchy skin. I would recommend this product it’s good refreshing face wash.
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-01,4,It says vitamin c but it has only lemon essential oil which is not vitamin c. Vitamin c is water soluble substance which offcourse doesn't exist in lemon oil and in this product. But it is a nice facewash. Very hydrating
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-07-02,5,This Mama Earth Vitamin C Face wash is really amazing ... it has got the benefits of Vitamin C and Turmeric .. it’s totally paraben and SLS free .. it suits all skin types .. it’s made of natural ingredients which are good for the skin .. this is truly the best Face wash I’ve ever used .. a must buy for all .. a value for money product undoubtedly!!
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-05,1,"Don't believe positive reviews of this product...Whoever said in negative reviews are genuine..I too experienced same as like negative comments..In single wash, my face became too darker than before..I was shocked after seeing the results....I was purchased by believing all positive comments..Have doubt on ingredients ..Please don't purchase this product.. Otherwise you ended with darker skin on face.."
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-14,1,"Don't buy if you want your skin to be like what you've now. If you want pimples you can. I usually don't get pimples. Have oily skin, but i maintain my diet. But this product will make sure you get atleast 2 pimples. I tested it twice by not using it for few days in the middle and my skin went to normal. But when i used it again the same happened.I tested again after few months and the same result."
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-11-21,1,"This was for my son to wash his face if he kept the face wash on his hand for about 5 minutes his hands got super dry and skin coming out. I don't recommend this product. It's not the first time, the quality of cosmetics on Amazon is not good,  you get many fake products.  It's not the way amazon gives their products to customers"
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2021-08-06,1,This is my first purchase of mama earth brand. I was keen to experience the goodness what most people are talking about. Packaging was nice but when I use this gel form face wash my eyes burn like hell. I can't even open my eyes a bit while washing face. This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-02,4,"I was looking for a mild facewash ;mamaearth is a good choice it doesn't harm your skin because no sulphates and parabeanThings I like about this productIt have a plasent smellIt have active vitamin CIt suits for all skin typesCruelty freeAffordable priceOne thing I don't like about this,they are written on their package it promotes even skin tone, I believe that face wash is not for whitening the face otherwise I like all about this product."

B0774TQRBZ,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-14,1,"Don't buy if you want your skin to be like what you've now. If you want pimples you can. I usually don't get pimples. Have oily skin, but i maintain my diet. But this product will make sure you get atleast 2 pimples. I tested it twice by not using it for few days in the middle and my skin went to normal. But when i used it again the same happened.I tested again after few months and the same result."
B0774TQRBZ,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-11-21,1,"This was for my son to wash his face if he kept the face wash on his hand for about 5 minutes his hands got super dry and skin coming out. I don't recommend this product. It's not the first time, the quality of cosmetics on Amazon is not good,  you get many fake products.  It's not the way amazon gives their products to customers"
B0774TQRBZ,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2021-08-06,1,This is my first purchase of mama earth brand. I was keen to experience the goodness what most people are talking about. Packaging was nice but when I use this gel form face wash my eyes burn like hell. I can't even open my eyes a bit while washing face. This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!
B0774TQRBZ,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-02,4,"I was looking for a mild facewash ;mamaearth is a good choice it doesn't harm your skin because no sulphates and parabeanThings I like about this productIt have a plasent smellIt have active vitamin CIt suits for all skin typesCruelty freeAffordable priceOne thing I don't like about this,they are written on their package it promotes even skin tone, I believe that face wash is not for whitening the face otherwise I like all about this product."

It has no added chemicals to it and good for both men and women and suitable for sensitive skin also as it has turmeric in it. One should try this amaing product.

When I used for the first time I don't believe it last longer but it last up to 8hrs with out oily, sticky skin, after using 4 days (daily 2 times) all cracks on my skin completely healed and became soft and healthy.

   Ordered this Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo on 27 November, 2019 and it was delivered on 28 November. At the time of purchase the price was 286rs.Lately i having hair fall issue and after going through a lot of reviews and recommend on this hair fall shampoo by popular youtubers decided to give it a try.Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is 100% made-up of natural materials if you going through the ingredients to get the best out of this shampoo apply onion oil or any good oil to your hair few hours before the wash no need to apply any type of other conditioner or soap just gently apply it on your hair. It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.

Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."

B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-14,1,"Don't buy if you want your skin to be like what you've now. If you want pimples you can. I usually don't get pimples. Have oily skin, but i maintain my diet. But this product will make sure you get atleast 2 pimples. I tested it twice by not using it for few days in the middle and my skin went to normal. But when i used it again the same happened.I tested again after few months and the same result."

B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2021-08-06,1,This is my first purchase of mama earth brand. I was keen to experience the goodness what most people are talking about. Packaging was nice but when I use this gel form face wash my eyes burn like hell. I can't even open my eyes a bit while washing face. This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!

   Ordered this Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo on 27 November, 2019 and it was delivered on 28 November. At the time of purchase the price was 286rs.Lately i having hair fall issue and after going through a lot of reviews and recommend on this hair fall shampoo by popular youtubers decided to give it a try.Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is 100% made-up of natural materials if you going through the ingredients to get the best out of this shampoo apply onion oil or any good oil to your hair few hours before the wash no need to apply any type of other conditioner or soap just gently apply it on your hair. It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."

It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,1,It's not good at all..Smell is okay and that's it. It doesn't cleanand neither removes oil from your hair.Might be okay for daily wash but not to clean wash. Don't go by the comments or rating given.Does it help in hairloss? I don't see any change even after several washes.
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-28,1,"Have order this product based on reviws and its pathetic. Vary oily,sticky. Waste of money. Just to save my comment selected 1 star but this is not a starworthy product,brand"
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-12-27,1,"i have curly frizzy hair. i tried many products but could not get softness and could not control hair fall also. hair fall happens due to internal conditions. after checking reviews for this brand product, thought of trying this product. The price is high according to me.  I lost so much hair when shampooing it self. shampoo is too sticky but after head bath hair is soft. when compared with hair loss, i stopped this product. when you are buying any product check the review dates .. if the review dates are within same time, we can ignore that product.. i tried such kind of products.. those are bad only at the end.. finally coming to this product. it is making hair shine but lost so much hair. may be this suits for only silky hair people as they don't loose so much hair while taking headbath."
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-08,1,"Firstly I don't like the packaging of this shampoo.When I received the product, it was leaking. Moreover the quantity of product in the bottle isn't visible.Upon usage I noticed that my hairfall significantly increased. It's hard to rinse off and has a very sticky and greasy texture."
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-11-12,2,"Reviews really helps to buy other people that’s why I’m always writing and I ll also buy product after read the reviews,Actually this product is not working for me , hair fall is not coming to control and falling more after start using this, and I am writing this after using 3 weeks, but it’s keeping hair soft , before this product I was used kadhi shikakai shampoo it’s control hair fall within 1 or 2 use, I’m not happy with mama earth , but I buy this after reading so many positive reviews"
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2020-11-26,5,Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is  made-up of natural ingredients its a paraben free sls free shampoo  It's  cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect.  So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive results. Overall really good product..
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-08-12,1,"I have heard a lot about Mamaearth products and so thought of using it for my eight months old baby. This review is particularly about Mamaearth Shampoo, Everytime I applied this shampoo on my baby she used to cry inconsolably.I was sure this is a tear free shampoo and shouldn't be causing any problem , however I thought of trying it by myself for once. I was shocked only to know that it's not at all tear free and irritated my eyes like hell. Since then I am concerned how much of irritation and itching my baby has suffered because of this. I definitely won't recommend this shampoo for babies, Big No No !"
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-16,1,There is a change of formulation of the product. Earlier it used to be thick but now it is quite liquidy. Change in the design of pump also which promotes wastage. The outcome of the product is also not good. The hair becomes dry. They have added a scent also now. Same is with the body wash. The quality of their products has deteriorated and cheap tactics of product wastage to promote sales is disappointing. The fact that they changed the formulation without mentioning it can be called cheating the customers. #nonethical business practices.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-13,3,What I liked :1. Plant based and minimal chemicals for baby safe usage2. No tears3. lathers well on oiled hairWhat concerned me:1. Scent is not good.Its ok2. Requires 2 washes for oiled hair to get rid of the grease completely (although I don’t go for 2nd round for my baby).3. This goes for all mama earth products: Overpriced.Just because it’s plant based /minimal chemicals.If you really want to go for 100% chemical free for your baby then you could prepare your own DIY using Fenugreek powder & curds. It’s messy a bit but 100 % safe for babies
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-06-08,4,It is a very mild shampoo. Gentle on the hair & scalp. Good for daily or alternate use. But my hair fall is still there.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-08-28,5,Very nice shampoo. Makes my baby’s hair soft and shiny with a nice light scent. I really like the ingredients in it
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-01-10,5,Good product from Mama earth. Lathers well and rinses off oil from my toddlers hair pretty easily. My daughter has curly dry hair but this one doesn't make it too dry. I tried brands like Aveeno & L'Oréal for kids but this one is far better than those. Have been using it since a year and pretty happy with the product
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-09-26,4,"I m 30 years old,, i have hair related problems from childhood,, so somebody told me to use baby shampoo,, i bought this one,, after johnsons baby shampoo,, this is good for cleaning oil,( applied one night before)from hairs in one wash,, u dont need to wash hair second time. Although it feels light burning while entering in the eyes so be careful when apply on babies. Hair becomes neither so rough nor so silky. Soso. I have dry hairs with dandruff issue. It helps in them."
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-01-01,1,Pathetic shampoo....guys it makes the hair very very rough dry ...and on the top pathetic hairfall.....i got scared wen i saw a hundreds of hair strand fallen on my baby's tshjrt collar just after first wash and i had stopped using this shampoo there after....and hair fall had stopped soon after its use...omg plz dont make ur kid use this type of product...worthless
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2017-10-29,5,This is a fabulous product having the quality as expected . It is worth the price. I appreciate the out of the box experience given by the manufacturer and the service of Amazon. Thank you Amazon.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-06-10,5,I really like the shampoo.. Very mild..but still I mix water to it before application..💓💓mild💓💓colourless shampoo💓💓honestly I don't like the scent but adjustable💓💓the shampoo is soft and makes hair soft💓💓Osm lather formation💜💜using it for ma 7month baby😍 the way I use ❤little amount by diluting waterI think it last for more than 4months as am using only a very little quantity Go for it..

B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-06-25,5,Consistency is gel like and has a light scent of orange which is refreshing I don’t mind the scent though..And I love this product after first time use. My skin is smooth and supple now It definitely brightens my skin after wash and leaves no dry stretchy skin. I would recommend this product it’s good refreshing face wash.
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-01,4,It says vitamin c but it has only lemon essential oil which is not vitamin c. Vitamin c is water soluble substance which offcourse doesn't exist in lemon oil and in this product. But it is a nice facewash. Very hydrating
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-07-02,5,This Mama Earth Vitamin C Face wash is really amazing ... it has got the benefits of Vitamin C and Turmeric .. it’s totally paraben and SLS free .. it suits all skin types .. it’s made of natural ingredients which are good for the skin .. this is truly the best Face wash I’ve ever used .. a must buy for all .. a value for money product undoubtedly!!
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-05,1,"Don't believe positive reviews of this product...Whoever said in negative reviews are genuine..I too experienced same as like negative comments..In single wash, my face became too darker than before..I was shocked after seeing the results....I was purchased by believing all positive comments..Have doubt on ingredients ..Please don't purchase this product.. Otherwise you ended with darker skin on face.."
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-14,1,"Don't buy if you want your skin to be like what you've now. If you want pimples you can. I usually don't get pimples. Have oily skin, but i maintain my diet. But this product will make sure you get atleast 2 pimples. I tested it twice by not using it for few days in the middle and my skin went to normal. But when i used it again the same happened.I tested again after few months and the same result."
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-11-21,1,"This was for my son to wash his face if he kept the face wash on his hand for about 5 minutes his hands got super dry and skin coming out. I don't recommend this product. It's not the first time, the quality of cosmetics on Amazon is not good,  you get many fake products.  It's not the way amazon gives their products to customers"
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2021-08-06,1,This is my first purchase of mama earth brand. I was keen to experience the goodness what most people are talking about. Packaging was nice but when I use this gel form face wash my eyes burn like hell. I can't even open my eyes a bit while washing face. This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-02,4,"I was looking for a mild facewash ;mamaearth is a good choice it doesn't harm your skin because no sulphates and parabeanThings I like about this productIt have a plasent smellIt have active vitamin CIt suits for all skin typesCruelty freeAffordable priceOne thing I don't like about this,they are written on their package it promotes even skin tone, I believe that face wash is not for whitening the face otherwise I like all about this product."

B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-11-20,5,"I have dry skin, during winter my skin cracks and bleeds almost all over the body I tried different remidies and products but not satisfied with the results. When I hear about Mama earth I just wanted to try once and bought coco body lotion. "" I'm surprised with the results"". When I used for the first time I don't believe it last longer but it last up to 8hrs with out oily, sticky skin, after using 4 days (daily 2 times) all cracks on my skin completely healed and became soft and healthy. Ok fragrance is good with chocolate and coffee fragrance, even I feel fragrance after 8hrs, but I get what I want for my skin"
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-12-04,4,"First impressions, lotion spreads well. Soft soothing fragrance. Hoping to see its result after use.Overall good buy during this offer. VFM to get 2 at cost of one.Reviewing this again after 2 months usage.Texture is similar to other brands.Smell is decent.Non-greasy after use. Seeps in skin.But its effect is not long lasting. My skin becoms dry within 2 hrs time."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-06-30,5,"I got 2×400ml mamaearth rose body lotion for just rs.399. So it was a very good steal for me. The scent is okay-ish. But after applying this on my face I sweat a lot. Most importantly, the products are cruelty-free, mamearth claims that. I just have a question ""mamaearth claims that they plant a tree for every purchase so did they really plant a tree when i bought their products from amazon not from their website?""Please do answer it.I received the broken cap of the second bottle."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-12,5,"Mamaearth Ubtan Body Lotion moisturizes my skin really well. This is non-sticky yet good for this winter. I apply this product only after showering and my skin is well hydrated throughout the day. The scent is mild so doesn't bother much. It helps to even out the skin tone too. It suits for differnt skin types too, like my skin is normal whereas my sister has dry skin and she gets good result too.It's a very good product overall."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-03,5,This lotion is hands down the best I've used so far. It smells like a heavenly cup of coffee with a huge slice of delicious chocolate cake. And my skin feels super soft and healthy. Love this ❤
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-12-27,5,The fragrance is good. Mosturising stays for long hours. The tempreture here where I stay is very low and also air is dry. I mix a little of other mosturiser in it but overall it is a good product.
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-03-10,5,Smells as of cocoa and coffee. Too good. Moisturizes well
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-01-29,4,"(Mamaearth) the name is enough to explain the product... Talking about the packaging, it's nicely packed in seal poly inside and cardboard packaging outside... Just go for it.. And you will love this"

   I liked it♥️The product is soooo good👍U can also try to buy this"
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-03-26,4,Not enough moisturizing even though I have oily skin. The scent is quite good. But does not linger. It takes a little while to get absorbed but lasts a long time on skin.
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-11-20,5,"I have dry skin, during winter my skin cracks and bleeds almost all over the body I tried different remidies and products but not satisfied with the results. When I hear about Mama earth I just wanted to try once and bought coco body lotion. "" I'm surprised with the results"". When I used for the first time I don't believe it last longer but it last up to 8hrs with out oily, sticky skin, after using 4 days (daily 2 times) all cracks on my skin completely healed and became soft and healthy. Ok fragrance is good with chocolate and coffee fragrance, even I feel fragrance after 8hrs, but I get what I want for my skin"
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-12-04,4,"First impressions, lotion spreads well. Soft soothing fragrance. Hoping to see its result after use.Overall good buy during this offer. VFM to get 2 at cost of one.Reviewing this again after 2 months usage.Texture is similar to other brands.Smell is decent.Non-greasy after use. Seeps in skin.But its effect is not long lasting. My skin becoms dry within 2 hrs time."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-06-30,5,"I got 2×400ml mamaearth rose body lotion for just rs.399. So it was a very good steal for me. The scent is okay-ish. But after applying this on my face I sweat a lot. Most importantly, the products are cruelty-free, mamearth claims that. I just have a question ""mamaearth claims that they plant a tree for every purchase so did they really plant a tree when i bought their products from amazon not from their website?""Please do answer it.I received the broken cap of the second bottle."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-12,5,"Mamaearth Ubtan Body Lotion moisturizes my skin really well. This is non-sticky yet good for this winter. I apply this product only after showering and my skin is well hydrated throughout the day. The scent is mild so doesn't bother much. It helps to even out the skin tone too. It suits for differnt skin types too, like my skin is normal whereas my sister has dry skin and she gets good result too.It's a very good product overall."

   Ordered this Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo on 27 November, 2019 and it was delivered on 28 November. At the time of purchase the price was 286rs.Lately i having hair fall issue and after going through a lot of reviews and recommend on this hair fall shampoo by popular youtubers decided to give it a try.Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is 100% made-up of natural materials if you going through the ingredients to get the best out of this shampoo apply onion oil or any good oil to your hair few hours before the wash no need to apply any type of other conditioner or soap just gently apply it on your hair. It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,1,It's not good at all..Smell is okay and that's it. It doesn't cleanand neither removes oil from your hair.Might be okay for daily wash but not to clean wash. Don't go by the comments or rating given.Does it help in hairloss? I don't see any change even after several washes.

B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-06-25,5,Consistency is gel like and has a light scent of orange which is refreshing I don’t mind the scent though..And I love this product after first time use. My skin is smooth and supple now It definitely brightens my skin after wash and leaves no dry stretchy skin. I would recommend this product it’s good refreshing face wash.

This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!

   Ordered this Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo on 27 November, 2019 and it was delivered on 28 November. At the time of purchase the price was 286rs.Lately i having hair fall issue and after going through a lot of reviews and recommend on this hair fall shampoo by popular youtubers decided to give it a try.Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is 100% made-up of natural materials if you going through the ingredients to get the best out of this shampoo apply onion oil or any good oil to your hair few hours before the wash no need to apply any type of other conditioner or soap just gently apply it on your hair. It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"

It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.

Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."

B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-08-12,1,"I have heard a lot about Mamaearth products and so thought of using it for my eight months old baby. This review is particularly about Mamaearth Shampoo, Everytime I applied this shampoo on my baby she used to cry inconsolably.I was sure this is a tear free shampoo and shouldn't be causing any problem , however I thought of trying it by myself for once. I was shocked only to know that it's not at all tear free and irritated my eyes like hell. Since then I am concerned how much of irritation and itching my baby has suffered because of this. I definitely won't recommend this shampoo for babies, Big No No !"
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-16,1,There is a change of formulation of the product. Earlier it used to be thick but now it is quite liquidy. Change in the design of pump also which promotes wastage. The outcome of the product is also not good. The hair becomes dry. They have added a scent also now. Same is with the body wash. The quality of their products has deteriorated and cheap tactics of product wastage to promote sales is disappointing. The fact that they changed the formulation without mentioning it can be called cheating the customers. #nonethical business practices.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-13,3,What I liked :1. Plant based and minimal chemicals for baby safe usage2. No tears3. lathers well on oiled hairWhat concerned me:1. Scent is not good.Its ok2. Requires 2 washes for oiled hair to get rid of the grease completely (although I don’t go for 2nd round for my baby).3. This goes for all mama earth products: Overpriced.Just because it’s plant based /minimal chemicals.If you really want to go for 100% chemical free for your baby then you could prepare your own DIY using Fenugreek powder & curds. It’s messy a bit but 100 % safe for babies
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-06-08,4,It is a very mild shampoo. Gentle on the hair & scalp. Good for daily or alternate use. But my hair fall is still there.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-08-28,5,Very nice shampoo. Makes my baby’s hair soft and shiny with a nice light scent. I really like the ingredients in it
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-01-10,5,Good product from Mama earth. Lathers well and rinses off oil from my toddlers hair pretty easily. My daughter has curly dry hair but this one doesn't make it too dry. I tried brands like Aveeno & L'Oréal for kids but this one is far better than those. Have been using it since a year and pretty happy with the product
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-09-26,4,"I m 30 years old,, i have hair related problems from childhood,, so somebody told me to use baby shampoo,, i bought this one,, after johnsons baby shampoo,, this is good for cleaning oil,( applied one night before)from hairs in one wash,, u dont need to wash hair second time. Although it feels light burning while entering in the eyes so be careful when apply on babies. Hair becomes neither so rough nor so silky. Soso. I have dry hairs with dandruff issue. It helps in them."

My skin is smooth and supple now It definitely brightens my skin after wash and leaves no dry stretchy skin. I would recommend this product it’s good refreshing face wash.
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-01,4,It says vitamin c but it has only lemon essential oil which is not vitamin c. Vitamin c is water soluble substance which offcourse doesn't exist in lemon oil and in this product. But it is a nice facewash. Very hydrating

But when i used it again the same happened.I tested again after few months and the same result."

This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!

B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-01-29,4,"(Mamaearth) the name is enough to explain the product... Talking about the packaging, it's nicely packed in seal poly inside and cardboard packaging outside... Just go for it.. And you will love this"

   I liked it♥️The product is soooo good👍U can also try to buy this"
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-03-26,4,Not enough moisturizing even though I have oily skin. The scent is quite good. But does not linger. It takes a little while to get absorbed but lasts a long time on skin.

Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,1,It's not good at all..Smell is okay and that's it.

But when i used it again the same happened.I tested again after few months and the same result."

B07WHJ5X6Q,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2021-08-06,1,This is my first purchase of mama earth brand. I was keen to experience the goodness what most people are talking about. Packaging was nice but when I use this gel form face wash my eyes burn like hell. I can't even open my eyes a bit while washing face. This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!

This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!

   Ordered this Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo on 27 November, 2019 and it was delivered on 28 November. At the time of purchase the price was 286rs.Lately i having hair fall issue and after going through a lot of reviews and recommend on this hair fall shampoo by popular youtubers decided to give it a try.Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is 100% made-up of natural materials if you going through the ingredients to get the best out of this shampoo apply onion oil or any good oil to your hair few hours before the wash no need to apply any type of other conditioner or soap just gently apply it on your hair. It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"

It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.

Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."

   Ordered this Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo on 27 November, 2019 and it was delivered on 28 November. At the time of purchase the price was 286rs.Lately i having hair fall issue and after going through a lot of reviews and recommend on this hair fall shampoo by popular youtubers decided to give it a try.Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is 100% made-up of natural materials if you going through the ingredients to get the best out of this shampoo apply onion oil or any good oil to your hair few hours before the wash no need to apply any type of other conditioner or soap just gently apply it on your hair. It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,1,It's not good at all..Smell is okay and that's it. It doesn't cleanand neither removes oil from your hair.Might be okay for daily wash but not to clean wash. Don't go by the comments or rating given.Does it help in hairloss? I don't see any change even after several washes.
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-28,1,"Have order this product based on reviws and its pathetic. Vary oily,sticky. Waste of money. Just to save my comment selected 1 star but this is not a starworthy product,brand"
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-12-27,1,"i have curly frizzy hair. i tried many products but could not get softness and could not control hair fall also. hair fall happens due to internal conditions. after checking reviews for this brand product, thought of trying this product. The price is high according to me.  I lost so much hair when shampooing it self. shampoo is too sticky but after head bath hair is soft. when compared with hair loss, i stopped this product. when you are buying any product check the review dates .. if the review dates are within same time, we can ignore that product.. i tried such kind of products.. those are bad only at the end.. finally coming to this product. it is making hair shine but lost so much hair. may be this suits for only silky hair people as they don't loose so much hair while taking headbath."
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-08,1,"Firstly I don't like the packaging of this shampoo.When I received the product, it was leaking. Moreover the quantity of product in the bottle isn't visible.Upon usage I noticed that my hairfall significantly increased. It's hard to rinse off and has a very sticky and greasy texture."
B08MF36S6C,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-11-12,2,"Reviews really helps to buy other people that’s why I’m always writing and I ll also buy product after read the reviews,Actually this product is not working for me , hair fall is not coming to control and falling more after start using this, and I am writing this after using 3 weeks, but it’s keeping hair soft , before this product I was used kadhi shikakai shampoo it’s control hair fall within 1 or 2 use, I’m not happy with mama earth , but I buy this after reading so many positive reviews"

B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-08-12,1,"I have heard a lot about Mamaearth products and so thought of using it for my eight months old baby. This review is particularly about Mamaearth Shampoo, Everytime I applied this shampoo on my baby she used to cry inconsolably.I was sure this is a tear free shampoo and shouldn't be causing any problem , however I thought of trying it by myself for once. I was shocked only to know that it's not at all tear free and irritated my eyes like hell. Since then I am concerned how much of irritation and itching my baby has suffered because of this. I definitely won't recommend this shampoo for babies, Big No No !"
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-16,1,There is a change of formulation of the product. Earlier it used to be thick but now it is quite liquidy. Change in the design of pump also which promotes wastage. The outcome of the product is also not good. The hair becomes dry. They have added a scent also now. Same is with the body wash. The quality of their products has deteriorated and cheap tactics of product wastage to promote sales is disappointing. The fact that they changed the formulation without mentioning it can be called cheating the customers. #nonethical business practices.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-13,3,What I liked :1. Plant based and minimal chemicals for baby safe usage2. No tears3. lathers well on oiled hairWhat concerned me:1. Scent is not good.Its ok2. Requires 2 washes for oiled hair to get rid of the grease completely (although I don’t go for 2nd round for my baby).3. This goes for all mama earth products: Overpriced.Just because it’s plant based /minimal chemicals.If you really want to go for 100% chemical free for your baby then you could prepare your own DIY using Fenugreek powder & curds. It’s messy a bit but 100 % safe for babies
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-06-08,4,It is a very mild shampoo. Gentle on the hair & scalp. Good for daily or alternate use. But my hair fall is still there.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-08-28,5,Very nice shampoo. Makes my baby’s hair soft and shiny with a nice light scent. I really like the ingredients in it
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-01-10,5,Good product from Mama earth. Lathers well and rinses off oil from my toddlers hair pretty easily. My daughter has curly dry hair but this one doesn't make it too dry. I tried brands like Aveeno & L'Oréal for kids but this one is far better than those. Have been using it since a year and pretty happy with the product
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2019-09-26,4,"I m 30 years old,, i have hair related problems from childhood,, so somebody told me to use baby shampoo,, i bought this one,, after johnsons baby shampoo,, this is good for cleaning oil,( applied one night before)from hairs in one wash,, u dont need to wash hair second time. Although it feels light burning while entering in the eyes so be careful when apply on babies. Hair becomes neither so rough nor so silky. Soso. I have dry hairs with dandruff issue. It helps in them."
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-01-01,1,Pathetic shampoo....guys it makes the hair very very rough dry ...and on the top pathetic hairfall.....i got scared wen i saw a hundreds of hair strand fallen on my baby's tshjrt collar just after first wash and i had stopped using this shampoo there after....and hair fall had stopped soon after its use...omg plz dont make ur kid use this type of product...worthless
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2017-10-29,5,This is a fabulous product having the quality as expected . It is worth the price. I appreciate the out of the box experience given by the manufacturer and the service of Amazon. Thank you Amazon.

B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-06-25,5,Consistency is gel like and has a light scent of orange which is refreshing I don’t mind the scent though..And I love this product after first time use. My skin is smooth and supple now It definitely brightens my skin after wash and leaves no dry stretchy skin. I would recommend this product it’s good refreshing face wash.
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-01,4,It says vitamin c but it has only lemon essential oil which is not vitamin c. Vitamin c is water soluble substance which offcourse doesn't exist in lemon oil and in this product. But it is a nice facewash. Very hydrating
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-07-02,5,This Mama Earth Vitamin C Face wash is really amazing ... it has got the benefits of Vitamin C and Turmeric .. it’s totally paraben and SLS free .. it suits all skin types .. it’s made of natural ingredients which are good for the skin .. this is truly the best Face wash I’ve ever used .. a must buy for all .. a value for money product undoubtedly!!
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-05,1,"Don't believe positive reviews of this product...Whoever said in negative reviews are genuine..I too experienced same as like negative comments..In single wash, my face became too darker than before..I was shocked after seeing the results....I was purchased by believing all positive comments..Have doubt on ingredients ..Please don't purchase this product.. Otherwise you ended with darker skin on face.."
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-14,1,"Don't buy if you want your skin to be like what you've now. If you want pimples you can. I usually don't get pimples. Have oily skin, but i maintain my diet. But this product will make sure you get atleast 2 pimples. I tested it twice by not using it for few days in the middle and my skin went to normal. But when i used it again the same happened.I tested again after few months and the same result."
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-11-21,1,"This was for my son to wash his face if he kept the face wash on his hand for about 5 minutes his hands got super dry and skin coming out. I don't recommend this product. It's not the first time, the quality of cosmetics on Amazon is not good,  you get many fake products.  It's not the way amazon gives their products to customers"
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2021-08-06,1,This is my first purchase of mama earth brand. I was keen to experience the goodness what most people are talking about. Packaging was nice but when I use this gel form face wash my eyes burn like hell. I can't even open my eyes a bit while washing face. This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-02,4,"I was looking for a mild facewash ;mamaearth is a good choice it doesn't harm your skin because no sulphates and parabeanThings I like about this productIt have a plasent smellIt have active vitamin CIt suits for all skin typesCruelty freeAffordable priceOne thing I don't like about this,they are written on their package it promotes even skin tone, I believe that face wash is not for whitening the face otherwise I like all about this product."

When I hear about Mama earth I just wanted to try once and bought coco body lotion. "" I'm surprised with the results"". When I used for the first time I don't believe it last longer but it last up to 8hrs with out oily, sticky skin, after using 4 days (daily 2 times) all cracks on my skin completely healed and became soft and healthy. Ok fragrance is good with chocolate and coffee fragrance, even I feel fragrance after 8hrs, but I get what I want for my skin"
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-12-04,4,"First impressions, lotion spreads well. Soft soothing fragrance. Hoping to see its result after use.Overall good buy during this offer. VFM to get 2 at cost of one.Reviewing this again after 2 months usage.Texture is similar to other brands.Smell is decent.Non-greasy after use. Seeps in skin.But its effect is not long lasting. My skin becoms dry within 2 hrs time."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-06-30,5,"I got 2×400ml mamaearth rose body lotion for just rs.399. So it was a very good steal for me. The scent is okay-ish. But after applying this on my face I sweat a lot. Most importantly, the products are cruelty-free, mamearth claims that. I just have a question ""mamaearth claims that they plant a tree for every purchase so did they really plant a tree when i bought their products from amazon not from their website?""Please do answer it.I received the broken cap of the second bottle."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-12,5,"Mamaearth Ubtan Body Lotion moisturizes my skin really well. This is non-sticky yet good for this winter. I apply this product only after showering and my skin is well hydrated throughout the day. The scent is mild so doesn't bother much. It helps to even out the skin tone too. It suits for differnt skin types too, like my skin is normal whereas my sister has dry skin and she gets good result too.It's a very good product overall."
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2022-01-03,5,This lotion is hands down the best I've used so far. It smells like a heavenly cup of coffee with a huge slice of delicious chocolate cake. And my skin feels super soft and healthy. Love this ❤
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-12-27,5,The fragrance is good. Mosturising stays for long hours. The tempreture here where I stay is very low and also air is dry. I mix a little of other mosturiser in it but overall it is a good product.
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-03-10,5,Smells as of cocoa and coffee. Too good. Moisturizes well
B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-01-29,4,"(Mamaearth) the name is enough to explain the product... Talking about the packaging, it's nicely packed in seal poly inside and cardboard packaging outside... Just go for it.. And you will love this"

B08R7D3K7G,Mamaearth-Ubtan-Body-Lotion-Pack,2021-03-26,4,Not enough moisturizing even though I have oily skin. The scent is quite good. But does not linger. It takes a little while to get absorbed but lasts a long time on skin.

   Ordered this Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo on 27 November, 2019 and it was delivered on 28 November. At the time of purchase the price was 286rs.Lately i having hair fall issue and after going through a lot of reviews and recommend on this hair fall shampoo by popular youtubers decided to give it a try.Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is 100% made-up of natural materials if you going through the ingredients to get the best out of this shampoo apply onion oil or any good oil to your hair few hours before the wash no need to apply any type of other conditioner or soap just gently apply it on your hair. It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.

Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."

My skin is smooth and supple now It definitely brightens my skin after wash and leaves no dry stretchy skin. I would recommend this product it’s good refreshing face wash.
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-01,4,It says vitamin c but it has only lemon essential oil which is not vitamin c. Vitamin c is water soluble substance which offcourse doesn't exist in lemon oil and in this product. But it is a nice facewash. Very hydrating
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-07-02,5,This Mama Earth Vitamin C Face wash is really amazing ... it has got the benefits of Vitamin C and Turmeric .. it’s totally paraben and SLS free .. it suits all skin types .. it’s made of natural ingredients which are good for the skin .. this is truly the best Face wash I’ve ever used .. a must buy for all .. a value for money product undoubtedly!!
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-05,1,"Don't believe positive reviews of this product...Whoever said in negative reviews are genuine..I too experienced same as like negative comments..In single wash, my face became too darker than before..I was shocked after seeing the results....I was purchased by believing all positive comments..Have doubt on ingredients ..Please don't purchase this product.. Otherwise you ended with darker skin on face.."
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-14,1,"Don't buy if you want your skin to be like what you've now. If you want pimples you can. I usually don't get pimples. Have oily skin, but i maintain my diet. But this product will make sure you get atleast 2 pimples. I tested it twice by not using it for few days in the middle and my skin went to normal. But when i used it again the same happened.I tested again after few months and the same result."
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-11-21,1,"This was for my son to wash his face if he kept the face wash on his hand for about 5 minutes his hands got super dry and skin coming out. I don't recommend this product. It's not the first time, the quality of cosmetics on Amazon is not good,  you get many fake products.  It's not the way amazon gives their products to customers"
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2021-08-06,1,This is my first purchase of mama earth brand. I was keen to experience the goodness what most people are talking about. Packaging was nice but when I use this gel form face wash my eyes burn like hell. I can't even open my eyes a bit while washing face. This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-02,4,"I was looking for a mild facewash ;mamaearth is a good choice it doesn't harm your skin because no sulphates and parabeanThings I like about this productIt have a plasent smellIt have active vitamin CIt suits for all skin typesCruelty freeAffordable priceOne thing I don't like about this,they are written on their package it promotes even skin tone, I believe that face wash is not for whitening the face otherwise I like all about this product."
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2021-02-11,5,The product is very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very nice product
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-06-28,5,Mamaearth vitamin C facewash is the best face wash i have ever used it has amazing fragrance and it makes your face cleaned deeply and yoh feels so refreshed. It has no added chemicals to it and good for both men and women and suitable for sensitive skin also as it has turmeric in it. One should try this amaing product.

It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever....

B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.

Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."
B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,1,It's not good at all..Smell is okay and that's it.

I was shocked only to know that it's not at all tear free and irritated my eyes like hell. Since then I am concerned how much of irritation and itching my baby has suffered because of this. I definitely won't recommend this shampoo for babies, Big No No !"
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-16,1,There is a change of formulation of the product. Earlier it used to be thick but now it is quite liquidy. Change in the design of pump also which promotes wastage. The outcome of the product is also not good. The hair becomes dry. They have added a scent also now. Same is with the body wash. The quality of their products has deteriorated and cheap tactics of product wastage to promote sales is disappointing. The fact that they changed the formulation without mentioning it can be called cheating the customers. #nonethical business practices.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-13,3,What I liked :1. Plant based and minimal chemicals for baby safe usage2. No tears3. lathers well on oiled hairWhat concerned me:1. Scent is not good.Its ok2. Requires 2 washes for oiled hair to get rid of the grease completely (although I don’t go for 2nd round for my baby).3. This goes for all mama earth products: Overpriced.Just because it’s plant based /minimal chemicals.If you really want to go for 100% chemical free for your baby then you could prepare your own DIY using Fenugreek powder & curds. It’s messy a bit but 100 % safe for babies
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-06-08,4,It is a very mild shampoo. Gentle on the hair & scalp. Good for daily or alternate use. But my hair fall is still there.

B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-06-25,5,Consistency is gel like and has a light scent of orange which is refreshing I don’t mind the scent though..And I love this product after first time use. My skin is smooth and supple now It definitely brightens my skin after wash and leaves no dry stretchy skin. I would recommend this product it’s good refreshing face wash.
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-01,4,It says vitamin c but it has only lemon essential oil which is not vitamin c. Vitamin c is water soluble substance which offcourse doesn't exist in lemon oil and in this product. But it is a nice facewash. Very hydrating

   Ordered this Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo on 27 November, 2019 and it was delivered on 28 November. At the time of purchase the price was 286rs.Lately i having hair fall issue and after going through a lot of reviews and recommend on this hair fall shampoo by popular youtubers decided to give it a try.Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is 100% made-up of natural materials if you going through the ingredients to get the best out of this shampoo apply onion oil or any good oil to your hair few hours before the wash no need to apply any type of other conditioner or soap just gently apply it on your hair. It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,1,It's not good at all..Smell is okay and that's it.

B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."

B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-05,1,"Don't believe positive reviews of this product...Whoever said in negative reviews are genuine..I too experienced same as like negative comments..In single wash, my face became too darker than before..I was shocked after seeing the results....I was purchased by believing all positive comments..Have doubt on ingredients ..Please don't purchase this product.. Otherwise you ended with darker skin on face.."
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-10-14,1,"Don't buy if you want your skin to be like what you've now. If you want pimples you can. I usually don't get pimples. Have oily skin, but i maintain my diet. But this product will make sure you get atleast 2 pimples. I tested it twice by not using it for few days in the middle and my skin went to normal. But when i used it again the same happened.I tested again after few months and the same result."
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-11-21,1,"This was for my son to wash his face if he kept the face wash on his hand for about 5 minutes his hands got super dry and skin coming out. I don't recommend this product. It's not the first time, the quality of cosmetics on Amazon is not good,  you get many fake products.  It's not the way amazon gives their products to customers"
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2021-08-06,1,This is my first purchase of mama earth brand. I was keen to experience the goodness what most people are talking about. Packaging was nice but when I use this gel form face wash my eyes burn like hell. I can't even open my eyes a bit while washing face. This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-02,4,"I was looking for a mild facewash ;mamaearth is a good choice it doesn't harm your skin because no sulphates and parabeanThings I like about this productIt have a plasent smellIt have active vitamin CIt suits for all skin typesCruelty freeAffordable priceOne thing I don't like about this,they are written on their package it promotes even skin tone, I believe that face wash is not for whitening the face otherwise I like all about this product."
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2021-02-11,5,The product is very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very nice product
B08R7F98PW,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-06-28,5,Mamaearth vitamin C facewash is the best face wash i have ever used it has amazing fragrance and it makes your face cleaned deeply and yoh feels so refreshed. It has no added chemicals to it and good for both men and women and suitable for sensitive skin also as it has turmeric in it. One should try this amaing product.

It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"

I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner...

B01NBEF38B,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.

Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."

I definitely won't recommend this shampoo for babies, Big No No !"
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-16,1,There is a change of formulation of the product. Earlier it used to be thick but now it is quite liquidy. Change in the design of pump also which promotes wastage. The outcome of the product is also not good. The hair becomes dry. They have added a scent also now. Same is with the body wash. The quality of their products has deteriorated and cheap tactics of product wastage to promote sales is disappointing. The fact that they changed the formulation without mentioning it can be called cheating the customers. #nonethical business practices.
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2020-07-13,3,What I liked :1. Plant based and minimal chemicals for baby safe usage2. No tears3. lathers well on oiled hairWhat concerned me:1. Scent is not good.Its ok2. Requires 2 washes for oiled hair to get rid of the grease completely (although I don’t go for 2nd round for my baby).3. This goes for all mama earth products: Overpriced.Just because it’s plant based /minimal chemicals.If you really want to go for 100% chemical free for your baby then you could prepare your own DIY using Fenugreek powder & curds. It’s messy a bit but 100 % safe for babies
B07Q2B5Z9D,Mamaearth-Gentle-Cleansing-Shampoo-babies,2018-06-08,4,It is a very mild shampoo. Gentle on the hair & scalp. Good for daily or alternate use. But my hair fall is still there.

B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-06-25,5,Consistency is gel like and has a light scent of orange which is refreshing I don’t mind the scent though..And I love this product after first time use. My skin is smooth and supple now It definitely brightens my skin after wash and leaves no dry stretchy skin. I would recommend this product it’s good refreshing face wash.
B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2020-09-01,4,It says vitamin c but it has only lemon essential oil which is not vitamin c. Vitamin c is water soluble substance which offcourse doesn't exist in lemon oil and in this product. But it is a nice facewash. Very hydrating

B077GZHQ4V,Mamaearth-Vitamin-Face-Turmeric-Illumination,2021-08-06,1,This is my first purchase of mama earth brand. I was keen to experience the goodness what most people are talking about. Packaging was nice but when I use this gel form face wash my eyes burn like hell. I can't even open my eyes a bit while washing face. This never happened with other brands face washes I have used so far. If the company claims that all natural ingredients are used in this product then why it has burning sensation in eyes? I fail to understand.  Is it safe? I don't know!

   Ordered this Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo on 27 November, 2019 and it was delivered on 28 November. At the time of purchase the price was 286rs.Lately i having hair fall issue and after going through a lot of reviews and recommend on this hair fall shampoo by popular youtubers decided to give it a try.Mamaearth Onion Hair Fall Shampoo is 100% made-up of natural materials if you going through the ingredients to get the best out of this shampoo apply onion oil or any good oil to your hair few hours before the wash no need to apply any type of other conditioner or soap just gently apply it on your hair. It's while cream like shampoo with nice smell price is also i must say it in mid range comparing to other expensive hair fall products.Honestly after my first wash i feel my hair very smooth hair fall is same but in case of hair fall you have to be patience!! Because it something have a long term effect. But after the few wash my hair fall has not increase ever since. So i am looking forward for it and seeing a positive resultsI will later write a detailed review and write the results about it!!!"
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,1,It's not good at all..Smell is okay and that's it. It doesn't cleanand neither removes oil from your hair.Might be okay for daily wash but not to clean wash. Don't go by the comments or rating given.Does it help in hairloss?

B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-12-27,1,"i have curly frizzy hair. i tried many products but could not get softness and could not control hair fall also. hair fall happens due to internal conditions. after checking reviews for this brand product, thought of trying this product. The price is high according to me.  I lost so much hair when shampooing it self. shampoo is too sticky but after head bath hair is soft. when compared with hair loss, i stopped this product. when you are buying any product check the review dates .. if the review dates are within same time, we can ignore that product.. i tried such kind of products.. those are bad only at the end.. finally coming to this product. it is making hair shine but lost so much hair. may be this suits for only silky hair people as they don't loose so much hair while taking headbath."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-08,1,"Firstly I don't like the packaging of this shampoo.When I received the product, it was leaking. Moreover the quantity of product in the bottle isn't visible.Upon usage I noticed that my hairfall significantly increased. It's hard to rinse off and has a very sticky and greasy texture."

B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,2,"Worst shampoo ever.... It made my hair so rough and dry that I had to comb them for half n hour more, to straighten them up.(It got so messed up and entangled... I have never felt this with any shampoo, ever )And yes this shampoo increased my hair ""fall""... My hair are pretty long and upon reading all good reviews, I bought this shampoo n conditioner... But my decision got proved totally wrong, in this case."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-06,5,This shampoo has a very refreshing fragrance and does not smell of onions at all. It helps in reducing hairfall and decreases hair frizziness. Makes hair smooth and soft. No need of applying an conditioner as it adequately moisturises the hair and scalp. I also used the onion hair mask and it also helped me soften my hair. A very good product free from sulphates and parabens. Makes the hair healthy and shiny.
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-09-10,5,"I was hesitant to try onion shampoo. However, decided to go for Mamaearth because I've heard a lot about the brand. Upon two uses, I can say it has not disappointed me. It has made my rough hair glossy. The feel is also good. I will update the review in 2 weeks. There has been negligible hairfall as of now. The first wash results last for at least 5 days.  Just washed my hair for the second time and have not used any stratening device. My hair is rough but straight. It has become smooth and straight. But my sister's hair is rough, thick and very wavy. It looks smooth and less wavy now. So, keratin seems to be working."
B08HYWPLL8,Mamaearth-Shampoo-Growth-Control-Keratin,2019-10-25,1,It's not good at all..Smell is okay and that's it. It doesn't cleanand neither removes oil from your hair.Might be okay for daily wash but not to clean wash. Don't go by the comments or rating given.Does it help in hairloss? I don't see any change even after several washes.
